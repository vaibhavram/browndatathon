0,Brain vasculature is a complex and interconnected network under tight regulatory  control that exists in intimate communication with neurons and glia. Typically hemodynamics are considered to exclusively serve as a metabolic support system. In contrast to this canonical view we propose that hemodynamics also play a role in information processing through modulation of neural activity. Functional hyperemia the basis of the functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal is a localized influx of blood correlated with neural activity levels. Functional hyperemia is considered by many to be excessive from a metabolic standpoint but may be appropriate if interpreted as having an activity-dependent neuro-modulatory function. Hemodynamics may impact neural activity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include delivery of diffusible blood-borne messengers and mechanical and thermal modulation of neural activity. Indirect mechanisms are proposed to act through hemodynamic modulation of astrocytes which can in turn regulate neural activity. These hemo-neural mechanisms should alter the information processing capacity of active local neural networks. Here  we focus on analysis of neocortical sensory processing. We predict that hemodynamics alter the gain of local cortical circuits modulating the detection  and discrimination of sensory stimuli. This novel view of information processing-that includes hemodynamics as an active and significant participant-has implications for understanding neural representation and the construction of accurate brain models. There are also potential medical benefits  of an improved understanding of the role of hemodynamics in neural processing as it directly bears on interpretation of and potential treatment for stroke dementia and epilepsy.,10.1152/jn.01366.2006
0,"Frontal neocortex is thought to support our highest intellectual abilities including our ability to plan and enact a sequence of tasks toward a desired goal. In everyday life such task sequences are abstract in that they do not require consistent movement sequences and are often assembled ""on the fly."" Yet  remarkably little is known about the necessity of frontal sub-regions for such control. Participants repeatedly completed sequences of simple tasks during fMRI  scanning. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) activation ramped over sequence position and reset at the initiation of each new sequence. To establish the necessity and function of RLPFC in this task participants performed the sequential task while undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the RLPFC versus two prefrontal control regions. Across two independent experiments  only RLPFC stimulation increasingly disrupted task performance as each sequence progressed. These data establish RLPFC as necessary for uncertainty resolution during sequence-level control.",10.1016/j.neuron.2015.08.026
0,Synchronous recruitment of fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin (PV) interneurons generates gamma oscillations rhythms that emerge during performance of cognitive tasks. Administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists alters  gamma rhythms and can induce cognitive as well as psychosis-like symptoms in humans. The disruption of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling specifically in FS PV interneurons is therefore hypothesized to give rise to neural network dysfunction that could underlie these symptoms. To address the connection between NMDAR activity FS PV interneurons gamma oscillations and behavior we generated mice  lacking NMDAR neurotransmission only in PV cells (PV-Cre/NR1f/f mice). Here we show that mutant mice exhibit enhanced baseline cortical gamma rhythms impaired  gamma rhythm induction after optogenetic drive of PV interneurons and reduced sensitivity to the effects of NMDAR antagonists on gamma oscillations and stereotypies. Mutant mice show largely normal behaviors except for selective cognitive impairments including deficits in habituation working memory and associative learning. Our results provide evidence for the critical role of NMDAR in PV interneurons for expression of normal gamma rhythms and specific cognitive  behaviors.,10.1038/mp.2011.31
0,Two general classes of hypotheses for the role for gamma oscillations in sensation are those that predict gamma facilitates signal amplification through local synchronization of a distinct ensemble and those that predict gamma modulates fine temporal relationships between neurons to represent information. Correlative evidence has been offered for and against these hypotheses. A recent  study in which gamma was optogenetically entrained by driving fast-spiking interneurons showed enhanced sensory detection of harder-to-perceive stimuli those that benefit most from attention in agreement with the amplification hypotheses. These findings are supported by similar studies employing less specific optogenetic patterns or single neuron stimulation but contrast with findings based on direct optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal neurons. Key next steps for this topic are described.,10.1016/j.conb.2015.02.004
0,Many procedures in modern clinical medicine rely on the use of electronic implants in treating conditions that range from acute coronary events to traumatic injury. However standard permanent electronic hardware acts as a nidus for infection: bacteria form biofilms along percutaneous wires or seed haematogenously with the potential to migrate within the body and to provoke immune-mediated pathological tissue reactions. The associated surgical retrieval  procedures meanwhile subject patients to the distress associated with re-operation and expose them to additional complications. Here we report materials device architectures integration strategies and in vivo demonstrations in rats of implantable multifunctional silicon sensors for the brain for which all of the constituent materials naturally resorb via hydrolysis and/or metabolic action eliminating the need for extraction. Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure and temperature illustrates functionality essential to the treatment of traumatic brain injury; the measurement performance of our resorbable devices compares favourably with that of non-resorbable clinical standards. In our experiments insulated percutaneous wires connect to an externally mounted miniaturized wireless potentiostat for data transmission.  In a separate set-up we connect a sensor to an implanted (but only partially resorbable) data-communication system proving the principle that there is no need for any percutaneous wiring. The devices can be adapted to sense fluid flow motion pH or thermal characteristics in formats that are compatible with the body's abdomen and extremities as well as the deep brain suggesting that the sensors might meet many needs in clinical medicine.,10.1038/nature16492
0,Several studies in patients with schizophrenia reported a marked reduction in sleep spindle activity. To investigate whether the reduction may be linked to genetic risk of the illness we analysed sleep spindle activity in healthy volunteers patients with schizophrenia and first-degree relatives who share an  enriched set of schizophrenia susceptibility genes. We further investigated the correlation of spindle activity with cognitive function in first-degree relatives and whether spindle abnormalities affect both fast (12-15 Hz) and slow (9-12 Hz)  sleep spindles. We investigated fast and slow sleep spindle activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep in a total of 47 subjects comprising 17 patients with schizophrenia 13 healthy first-degree relatives and 17 healthy volunteers.  Groups were balanced for age gender years of education and estimated verbal IQ. A subsample of relatives received additional testing for memory performance. Compared to healthy volunteers fast spindle density was reduced in patients with schizophrenia and healthy first-degree relatives following a pattern consistent with an assumed genetic load for schizophrenia. The deficit in spindle density was specific to fast spindles and was associated with decreased memory performance. Our findings indicate familial occurrence of this phenotype and thus support the hypothesis that deficient spindle activity relates to genetic liability for schizophrenia. Furthermore spindle reductions predict impaired cognitive function and are specific to fast spindles. This physiological marker should be further investigated as an intermediate phenotype of schizophrenia. It  could also constitute a target for drug development especially with regard to cognitive dysfunction.,10.1007/s00406-016-0725-2
0,Corticothalamic neurons provide massive input to the thalamus. This top-down projection may allow the cortex to regulate sensory processing by modulating the  excitability of thalamic cells. Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons monosynaptically  excite thalamocortical cells but also indirectly inhibit them by driving inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Whether corticothalamic activity generally suppresses or excites the thalamus remains unclear. Here we show that the corticothalamic influence is dynamic with the excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting in an activity-dependent fashion. During low-frequency activity corticothalamic effects are mainly suppressive whereas higher-frequency activity (even a short bout of gamma frequency oscillations) converts the corticothalamic influence to enhancement. The mechanism of this switching depends on distinct forms of short-term synaptic plasticity across multiple corticothalamic circuit components. Our results reveal an activity-dependent mechanism by which corticothalamic neurons can bidirectionally switch the excitability and sensory throughput of the thalamus possibly to meet  changing behavioral demands.,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.040
0,Sensory regions of the brain integrate environmental cues with copies of motor-related signals important for imminent and ongoing movements. In mammals signals propagating from the motor cortex to the auditory cortex are thought to have a critical role in normal hearing and behaviour yet the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which these motor-related signals influence auditory cortical activity remain poorly understood. Using in vivo intracellular recordings in behaving mice we find that excitatory neurons in the auditory cortex are suppressed before and during movement owing in part to increased activity of local parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Electrophysiology and optogenetic gain- and loss-of-function experiments reveal that motor-related changes in auditory cortical dynamics are driven by a subset of neurons in the secondary motor cortex that innervate the auditory cortex and are active during movement. These findings provide a synaptic and circuit basis for the motor-related corollary discharge hypothesized to facilitate hearing and auditory-guided behaviours.,10.1038/nature13724
0,Over a century of scientific work has focused on defining the factors motivating  behavioral learning. Observations in animals and humans trained on a wide range of tasks support reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as accounting for the learning. Still unknown however are the signals that drive learning in naive untrained subjects. Here we capitalized on a sequential saccade task in which macaque monkeys acquired repetitive scanning sequences without instruction. We found that spike activity in the caudate nucleus after each trial corresponded to an integrated cost-benefit signal that was highly correlated with the degree of naturalistic untutored learning by the monkeys. Across learning neurons encoding both cost and outcome gradually acquired increasingly sharp phasic trial-end responses that paralleled the development of the habit-like repetitive saccade sequences. Our findings demonstrate an integrated cost-benefit signal by which RL and its neural correlates could drive naturalistic behaviors in freely behaving primates.,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.07.019
0,Most aquatic vertebrates use suction to capture food relying on rapid expansion  of the mouth cavity to accelerate water and food into the mouth. In ray-finned fishes mouth expansion is both fast and forceful and therefore requires considerable power. However the cranial muscles of these fishes are relatively small and may not be able to produce enough power for suction expansion. The axial swimming muscles of these fishes also attach to the feeding apparatus and have the potential to generate mouth expansion. Because of their large size these axial muscles could contribute substantial power to suction feeding. To determine whether suction feeding is powered primarily by axial muscles we measured the power required for suction expansion in largemouth bass and compared it to the power capacities of the axial and cranial muscles. Using X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) we generated 3D animations of the mouth skeleton and created a dynamic digital endocast to measure the rate of mouth volume expansion. This time-resolved expansion rate was combined with intraoral pressure recordings to calculate the instantaneous power required for suction feeding. Peak expansion powers for all but the weakest strikes far exceeded the maximum power capacity of the cranial muscles. The axial muscles did not merely contribute but were the primary source of suction expansion power and  generated up to 95% of peak expansion power. The recruitment of axial muscle power may have been crucial for the evolution of high-power suction feeding in ray-finned fishes.,10.1073/pnas.1508055112
0,Marker-based XROMM requires software tools for: (1) correcting fluoroscope distortion; (2) calibrating X-ray cameras; (3) tracking radio-opaque markers; and (4) calculating rigid body motion. In this paper we describe and validate XMALab a new open-source software package for marker-based XROMM (C++ source and compiled versions on Bitbucket). Most marker-based XROMM studies to date have used XrayProject in MATLAB. XrayProject can produce results with excellent accuracy and precision but it is somewhat cumbersome to use and requires a MATLAB license. We have designed XMALab to accelerate the XROMM process and to make it more accessible to new users. Features include the four XROMM steps (listed above) in one cohesive user interface real-time plot windows for detecting errors and integration with an online data management system XMAPortal. Accuracy and precision of XMALab when tracking markers in a machined object are ±0.010 and ±0.043 mm respectively. Mean precision for nine users tracking markers in a tutorial dataset of minipig feeding was ±0.062 mm in XMALab and ±0.14 mm in XrayProject. Reproducibility of 3D point locations across nine users was 10-fold greater in XMALab than in XrayProject and six degree-of-freedom bone motions calculated with a joint coordinate system were 3-  to 6-fold more reproducible in XMALab. XMALab is also suitable for tracking white or black markers in standard light videos with optional checkerboard calibration. We expect XMALab to increase both the quality and quantity of animal motion data  available for comparative biomechanics research.,10.1242/jeb.145383
0,BACKGROUND: In the neurodevelopmental disorder autism several neuroimmune abnormalities have been reported. However it is unknown whether microglial somal volume or density are altered in the cortex and whether any alteration is associated with age or other potential covariates. METHODS: Microglia in sections from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of nonmacrencephalic male cases with autism (n = 13) and control cases (n = 9) were  visualized via ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 immunohistochemistry. In addition to a neuropathological assessment microglial cell density was stereologically estimated via optical fractionator and average somal volume was quantified via isotropic nucleator. RESULTS: Microglia appeared markedly activated in 5 of 13 cases with autism including 2 of 3 under age 6 and marginally activated in an additional 4 of 13 cases. Morphological alterations included somal enlargement process retraction and thickening and extension of filopodia from processes. Average microglial somal volume was significantly increased in white matter (p = .013) with a trend in gray matter (p = .098). Microglial cell density was increased in gray matter (p = .002). Seizure history did not influence any activation measure. CONCLUSIONS: The activation profile described represents a neuropathological alteration in a sizeable fraction of cases with autism. Given its early presence microglial activation may play a central role in the pathogenesis of autism in a  substantial proportion of patients. Alternatively activation may represent a response of the innate neuroimmune system to synaptic neuronal or neuronal network disturbances or reflect genetic and/or environmental abnormalities impacting multiple cellular populations.,10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.05.024
0,BACKGROUND: Besides the central role of the adaptive immune system a disturbance of innate immune system is also suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). CD14 a receptor upregulated in activated microglia is  known to be an essential mediator of inflammation in innate immune responses. Therefore in this study we aimed to assess possible roles of CD14-159 and -260 gene polymorphisms in MS susceptibility and the effects of those polymorphisms to its protein producing capacity in Iranian population. METHODS: In this case control study CD14-159 and -260 polymorphisms were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 200 MS patients and 200 healthy controls matched in age and gender. Serum levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: There were significant differences in genotype distribution of CD14-159  and -260 polymorphisms between patients and controls (P = 0.01 for-both). Mean serum level of sCD14 was significantly higher in MS patients than in control subjects (3340.30 ± 612.50 ng/ml vs 2353.73 ± 539.07 ng/ml; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In summary we conclude that CD14-159 and -260 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of MS in Iranian population and affects CD14 promoter activity thereby regulating CD14 expression. Furthermore our study provides preliminary evidence for the activation of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of MS. In addition the findings of the present study suggest serum level of sCD14 as candidate biomarker of MS severity.,10.1080/08820139.2016.1226897
0,"The retina reports the visual scene to the brain through many parallel channels  each carried by a distinct population of retinal ganglion cells. Among these the population with the smallest and densest receptive fields encodes the neural image with highest resolution. In human retina and those of cat and macaque these high-resolution ganglion cells act as generic pixel encoders: They serve to represent many different visual inputs and convey a neural image of the scene downstream for further processing. Here we identify and analyze high-resolution ganglion cells in the mouse retina using a transgenic line in which these cells called ""W3"" are labeled fluorescently. Counter to the expectation these ganglion cells do not participate in encoding generic visual scenes but remain silent during most common visual stimuli. A detailed study of their response properties showed that W3 cells pool rectified excitation from both On and Off bipolar cells which makes them sensitive to local motion. However they also receive unusually strong lateral inhibition both pre- and postsynaptically triggered by distant motion. As a result the W3 cell can detect small moving objects down to the receptive field size of bipolar cells but only if the background is featureless or stationary--an unusual condition. A survey of naturalistic stimuli shows that W3 cells may serve as alarm neurons for overhead  predators.",10.1073/pnas.1211547109
0,As the tissue macrophages of the CNS microglia are critically involved in diseases of the CNS. However it remains unknown what controls their maturation and activation under homeostatic conditions. We observed substantial contributions of the host microbiota to microglia homeostasis as germ-free (GF)  mice displayed global defects in microglia with altered cell proportions and an immature phenotype leading to impaired innate immune responses. Temporal eradication of host microbiota severely changed microglia properties. Limited microbiota complexity also resulted in defective microglia. In contrast recolonization with a complex microbiota partially restored microglia features. We determined that short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) microbiota-derived bacterial fermentation products regulated microglia homeostasis. Accordingly mice deficient for the SCFA receptor FFAR2 mirrored microglia defects found under GF conditions. These findings suggest that host bacteria vitally regulate microglia  maturation and function whereas microglia impairment can be rectified to some extent by complex microbiota.,10.1038/nn.4030
0,The mammalian AII retinal amacrine cell is a narrow-field multistratified glycinergic neuron best known for its role in collecting scotopic signals from rod bipolar cells and distributing them to ON and OFF cone pathways in a crossover network via a combination of inhibitory synapses and heterocellular AII::ON cone bipolar cell gap junctions. Long considered a simple cell a full connectomics analysis shows that AII cells possess the most complex interaction repertoire of any known vertebrate neuron contacting at least 28 different cell  classes including every class of retinal bipolar cell. Beyond its basic role in  distributing rod signals to cone pathways the AII cell may also mediate narrow-field feedback and feedforward inhibition for the photopic OFF channel photopic ON-OFF inhibitory crossover signaling and serves as a nexus for a collection of inhibitory networks arising from cone pathways that likely negotiate fast switching between cone and rod vision. Further analysis of the complete synaptic counts for five AII cells shows that (1) synaptic sampling is normalized for anatomic target encounter rates; (2) qualitative targeting is specific and apparently errorless; and (3) that AII cells strongly differentiate  partner cohorts by synaptic and/or coupling weights. The AII network is a dense hub connecting all primary retinal excitatory channels via precisely weighted drive and specific polarities. Homologs of AII amacrine cells have yet to be identified in non-mammalians but we propose that such homologs should be narrow-field glycinergic amacrine cells driving photopic ON-OFF crossover via heterocellular coupling with ON cone bipolar cells and glycinergic synapses on OFF cone bipolar cells. The specific evolutionary event creating the mammalian AII scotopic-photopic hub would then simply be the emergence of large numbers of  pure rod bipolar cells.,10.3389/fncir.2014.00104

0,"Synaptic plasticity is critical for elaboration and adaptation in the developing  and developed brain. It is well established that astrocytes play an important role in the maintenance of what has been dubbed ""the tripartite synapse"". Increasing evidence shows that a fourth cell type microglia is critical to this maintenance as well. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of their well-characterized inflammatory functions research has primarily focused on their innate immune properties. The role of microglia in the maintenance of synapses in development and in homeostasis is not as well defined. A number of significant findings have shed light on the critical role of microglia at the synapse. It is becoming increasingly clear that microglia play a seminal role in proper synaptic development and elimination.",10.1155/2013/627325
0,Glutamatergic cytotoxicity mediated by overactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is implicated in numerous neurological disorders. To be therapeutically viable NMDAR antagonists must preserve physiological role of synaptic NMDARs (sNMDARs) in synaptic transmission and block only excessive pathological activation of NMDARs. Here we present a novel NMDAR antagonist that  satisfies this two-fold requirement by exploiting spatial differences in NMDAR subcellular locations. Specifically we designed a hybrid nanodrug (AuM) to be larger than the synaptic cleft by attaching memantine NMDAR antagonist via polymer linkers to a gold nanoparticle. We show that AuM efficiently and selectively inhibited extrasynaptic NMDARs (eNMDARs) while having no effect on sNMDARs and synaptic transmission. AuM exhibited neuroprotective properties both  in vitro and ex vivo during such neurotoxic insults as NMDAR-mediated cytotoxicity in cerebrocortical cell culture and oxygen-glucose deprivation in acute hippocampal slices. Furthermore AuM prevented dendritic spine loss triggered by Aβ oligomers in organotypic hippocampal slices and was more effective than free memantine. Using a novel rational design strategy we demonstrate a proof of concept for a new class of neuroprotective drugs that might be beneficial for treatment of several neurological disorders.,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988
0,Previous research demonstrated that while selectively attending to relevant aspects of the external world the brain extracts pertinent information by aligning its neuronal oscillations to key time points of stimuli or their sampling by sensory organs. This alignment mechanism is termed oscillatory entrainment. We investigated the global long-timescale dynamics of this mechanism in the primary auditory cortex of nonhuman primates and hypothesized that lapses of entrainment would correspond to lapses of attention. By examining  electrophysiological and behavioral measures we observed that besides the lack of entrainment by external stimuli attentional lapses were also characterized by high-amplitude alpha oscillations with alpha frequency structuring of neuronal ensemble and single-unit operations. Entrainment and alpha-oscillation-dominated  periods were strongly anticorrelated and fluctuated rhythmically at an ultra-slow rate. Our results indicate that these two distinct brain states represent externally versus internally oriented computational resources engaged by large-scale task-positive and task-negative functional networks.,10.1038/nn.4386

0,Here we identified release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the choroid plexus epithelium (CPE) as a new mechanism of blood-brain communication. Systemic inflammation induced an increase in EVs and associated pro-inflammatory miRNAs including miR-146a and miR-155 in the CSF Interestingly this was associated with an increase in amount of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and exosomes per MVB in the CPE cells. Additionally we could mimic this using LPS-stimulated primary  CPE cells and choroid plexus explants. These choroid plexus-derived EVs can enter the brain parenchyma and are taken up by astrocytes and microglia inducing miRNA target repression and inflammatory gene up-regulation. Interestingly this could  be blocked in vivo by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of an inhibitor of  exosome production. Our data show that CPE cells sense and transmit information about the peripheral inflammatory status to the central nervous system (CNS) via  the release of EVs into the CSF which transfer this pro-inflammatory message to  recipient brain cells. Additionally we revealed that blockage of EV secretion decreases brain inflammation which opens up new avenues to treat systemic inflammatory diseases such as sepsis.,10.15252/emmm.201606271
0,Recently microglia the resident immune cells of the brain have been recognized  as multi-tasking talents that are not only essential in the diseased brain but also actively contribute to synaptic circuit remodeling during normal brain development. It is well established that microglia dynamically scan their environment and thereby establish transient physical contacts with neuronal synapses which may allow them to sense and influence synaptic function. However it is unknown whether and how the morphological dynamics of microglia and their physical interactions with synapses are affected by the induction of synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. To this end we characterized the morphological dynamics of microglia and their interactions with synapses before and after the induction of synaptic plasticity (LTP) in the hippocampus by time-lapse two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices. We  demonstrate that during hippocampal LTP microglia alter their morphological dynamics by increasing the number of their processes and by prolonging their physical contacts with dendritic spines. These effects were absent in the presence of an NMDA receptor antagonist. Taken together this altered behavior could reflect an active microglial involvement in circuit remodeling during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the healthy adult brain.,10.1038/srep32422
0,Glial cells previously thought to have generally supporting roles in the central nervous system are emerging as essential contributors to multiple aspects of neuronal circuit function and development. This review focuses on the contributions of glial cells to the development of auditory pathways in the brainstem. These pathways display specialized synapses and an unusually high degree of precision in circuitry that enables sound source localization. The development of these pathways thus requires highly coordinated molecular and cellular mechanisms. Several classes of glial cells including astrocytes oligodendrocytes and microglia have now been explored in these circuits in both  avian and mammalian brainstems. Distinct populations of astrocytes are found over the course of auditory brainstem maturation. Early appearing astrocytes are associated with spatial compartments in the avian auditory brainstem. Factors from late appearing astrocytes promote synaptogenesis and dendritic maturation and astrocytes remain integral parts of specialized auditory synapses. Oligodendrocytes play a unique role in both birds and mammals in highly regulated myelination essential for proper timing to decipher interaural cues. Microglia arise early in brainstem development and may contribute to maturation of auditory pathways. Together these studies demonstrate the importance of non-neuronal cells in the assembly of specialized auditory brainstem circuits.,10.3389/fncir.2016.00083
0,The emerging field of bioelectronic medicine seeks methods for deciphering and modulating electrophysiological activity in the body to attain therapeutic effects at target organs. Current approaches to interfacing with peripheral nerves and muscles rely heavily on wires creating problems for chronic use while emerging wireless approaches lack the size scalability necessary to interrogate small-diameter nerves. Furthermore conventional electrode-based technologies lack the capability to record from nerves with high spatial resolution or to record independently from many discrete sites within a nerve bundle. Here we demonstrate neural dust a wireless and scalable ultrasonic backscatter system for powering and communicating with implanted bioelectronics.  We show that ultrasound is effective at delivering power to mm-scale devices in tissue; likewise passive battery-less communication using backscatter enables high-fidelity transmission of electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram (ENG) signals from anesthetized rats. These results highlight the potential for an ultrasound-based neural interface system for advancing future bioelectronics-based therapies.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.06.034

0,Microglia actively survey the brain microenvironment and play essential roles in  sculpting synaptic connections during brain development. While microglial functions in the adult brain are less clear activated microglia can closely appose neuronal cell bodies and displace axosomatic presynaptic terminals. Microglia-mediated stripping of presynaptic terminals is considered neuroprotective but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. Using 3D electron microscopy we demonstrate that activated microglia displace inhibitory presynaptic terminals from cortical neurons in adult mice. Electrophysiological recordings further establish that the reduction in inhibitory GABAergic synapses increased synchronized firing of cortical neurons in γ-frequency band. Increased neuronal activity results in the calcium-mediated  activation of CaM kinase IV phosphorylation of CREB increased expression of antiapoptotic and neurotrophic molecules and reduced apoptosis of cortical neurons following injury. These results indicate that activated microglia can protect the adult brain by migrating to inhibitory synapses and displacing them from cortical neurons.,10.1038/ncomms5486

0,Cortical gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease. Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons with the resulting  rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking  interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude  and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.,10.1038/nature08002
0,While signatures of attention have been extensively studied in sensory systems the neural sources and computations responsible for top-down control of attention are largely unknown. Using chronic recordings in mice we found that fast-spiking parvalbumin (FS-PV) interneurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) uniformly show increased and sustained firing during goal-driven attentional processing correlating to the level of attention. Elevated activity of FS-PV neurons on the  timescale of seconds predicted successful execution of behavior. Successful allocation of attention was characterized by strong synchronization of FS-PV neurons increased gamma oscillations and phase locking of pyramidal firing. Phase-locked pyramidal neurons showed gamma-phase-dependent rate modulation during successful attentional processing. Optogenetic silencing of FS-PV neurons  deteriorated attentional processing while optogenetic synchronization of FS-PV neurons at gamma frequencies had pro-cognitive effects and improved goal-directed behavior. FS-PV neurons thus act as a functional unit coordinating the activity in the local mPFC circuit during goal-driven attentional processing.,10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.038
0,Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70 Hz). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by  the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the  irrelevant distractor. Thus enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.,10.1038/nature04258
0,Studies of neural oscillations in the beta band (13-30 Hz) have demonstrated modulations in beta-band power associated with sensory and motor events on time scales of 1 s or more and have shown that these are exaggerated in Parkinson's disease. However even early reports of beta activity noted extremely fleeting episodes of beta-band oscillation lasting <150 ms. Because the interpretation of  possible functions for beta-band oscillations depends strongly on the time scale  over which they occur and because of these oscillations' potential importance in Parkinson's disease and related disorders we analyzed in detail the distributions of duration and power for beta-band activity in a large dataset recorded in the striatum and motor-premotor cortex of macaque monkeys performing  reaching tasks. Both regions exhibited typical beta-band suppression during movement and postmovement rebounds of up to 3 s as viewed in data averaged across trials but single-trial analysis showed that most beta oscillations occurred in  brief bursts commonly 90-115 ms long. In the motor cortex the burst probabilities peaked following the last movement but in the striatum the burst  probabilities peaked at task end after reward and continued through the postperformance period. Thus what appear to be extended periods of postperformance beta-band synchronization reflect primarily the modulated densities of short bursts of synchrony occurring in region-specific and task-time-specific patterns. We suggest that these short-time-scale events likely underlie the functions of most beta-band activity so that prolongation of these  beta episodes as observed in Parkinson's disease could produce deleterious network-level signaling.,10.1073/pnas.1517629112

0,In this study we used a novel multisensory attention paradigm to investigate attention-modulated cortical oscillations over a wide range of frequencies using  magnetencephalography in healthy human participants. By employing a task that required the evaluation of the congruence of audio-visual stimuli we promoted the formation of widespread cortical networks including early sensory cortices as well as regions associated with cognitive control. We found that attention led to increased high-frequency gamma-band activity and decreased lower frequency theta- alpha- and beta-band activity in early sensory cortex areas. Moreover alpha-band coherence decreased in visual cortex. Frontal cortex was found to exert attentional control through increased low-frequency phase synchronisation.  Crossmodal congruence modulated beta-band coherence in mid-cingulate and superior temporal cortex. Together these results offer an integrative view on the concurrence of oscillations at different frequencies during multisensory attention.,10.1038/srep32775
0,Despite many prior studies demonstrating offline behavioral gains in motor skills after sleep the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. To investigate the neurophysiological basis for offline gains we performed single-unit recordings in motor cortex as rats learned a skilled upper-limb task. We found that sleep improved movement speed with preservation of accuracy. These  offline improvements were linked to both replay of task-related ensembles during  non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements; such offline gains and temporal shifts were not evident with sleep restriction. Interestingly replay was linked to the  coincidence of slow-wave events and bursts of spindle activity. Neurons that experienced the most consistent replay also underwent the most significant temporal shift and binding to the motor task. Significantly replay and the associated performance gains after sleep only occurred when animals first learned the skill; continued practice during later stages of learning (i.e. after motor  kinematics had stabilized) did not show evidence of replay. Our results highlight how replay of synchronous neural activity during sleep mediates large-scale neural plasticity and stabilizes kinematics during early motor learning.,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002263
0,The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia presumably result from impairments of information processing in neural circuits. We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus of freely behaving mice that had a forebrain-specific knockout of the synaptic plasticity-mediating phosphatase calcineurin and were previously shown to exhibit behavioral and cognitive abnormalities recapitulating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Calcineurin knockout (KO) mice exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in the abundance of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events during awake resting periods and  single units in KO were overactive during SWR events. Pairwise measures of unit activity however revealed that the sequential reactivation of place cells during SWR events was completely abolished in KO. Since this relationship during  postexperience awake rest periods has been implicated in learning working memory and subsequent memory consolidation our findings provide a mechanism underlying impaired information processing that may contribute to the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.,10.1016/j.neuron.2013.09.014
0,Spontaneous activity in the developing brain helps refine neuronal connections before the arrival of sensory-driven neuronal activity. In mouse neocortex during the first postnatal week waves of spontaneous activity originating from pacemaker regions in the septal nucleus and piriform cortex propagate through the neocortex. Using high-speed Ca(2+) imaging to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave propagation in parasagittal mouse brain slices we show that the hippocampus can act as an additional source of neocortical waves. Some waves that originate in the hippocampus remain restricted to that structure while others pause at the hippocampus-neocortex boundary and then propagate into the neocortex. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission decreases the likelihood of wave  propagation into neocortex whereas blocking glutamatergic neurotransmission eliminates spontaneous and evoked hippocampal waves. A subset of hippocampal and  cortical waves trigger Ca(2+) waves in astrocytic networks after a brief delay. Hippocampal waves accompanied by Ca(2+) elevation in astrocytes are more likely to propagate into the neocortex. Finally we show that two structures in our preparation that initiate waves-the hippocampus and the piriform cortex-can be electrically stimulated to initiate propagating waves at lower thresholds than the neocortex indicating that the intrinsic circuit properties of those regions  are responsible for their pacemaker function.,10.1002/dneu.22351
0,Dendrites are neuronal structures specialized for receiving and processing information through their many synaptic inputs. How input strengths are modified  across dendrites in ways that are crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity remains unclear. We examined in single hippocampal neurons the mechanism of heterosynaptic interactions and the heterogeneity of synaptic strengths of pyramidal cell inputs. Heterosynaptic presynaptic plasticity that counterbalances input strengths requires N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and astrocytes.  Importantly this mechanism is shared with the mechanism for maintaining highly heterogeneous basal presynaptic strengths which requires astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling involving NMDAR activation astrocyte membrane depolarization and L-type Ca(2+) channels. Intracellular infusion of NMDARs or Ca(2+)-channel blockers into astrocytes conditionally ablating the GluN1 NMDAR subunit or optogenetically hyperpolarizing astrocytes with archaerhodopsin promotes homogenization of convergent presynaptic inputs. Our findings support the presence of an astrocyte-dependent cellular mechanism that enhances the heterogeneity of presynaptic strengths of convergent connections which may help  boost the computational power of dendrites.,10.1073/pnas.1523717113
0,Evolution of the nervous system progressed through cellular diversification and specialization of functions. Conceptually the nervous system is composed from electrically excitable neuronal networks connected with chemical synapses and non-excitable glial cells that provide for homeostasis and defence. Astrocytes are integrated into neural networks through multipartite synapses; astroglial perisynaptic processes closely enwrap synaptic contacts and control homeostasis of the synaptic cleft supply neurons with glutamate and GABA obligatory precursor glutamine and contribute to synaptic plasticity learning and memory. In neuropathology astrocytes may undergo reactive remodelling or degeneration; to a large extent astroglial reactions define progression of the pathology and neurological outcome.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolution brings Ca(2+) and ATP together to control life and death'.,10.1098/rstb.2015.0428

0,Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation and turnover provides a sink for the elimination of solutes from the brain interstitium serving an important homeostatic role for the function of the central nervous system. Disruption of normal CSF circulation and turnover is believed to contribute to the development  of many diseases including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease ischemic and traumatic brain injury and neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Recent insights into CSF biology suggesting that CSF  and interstitial fluid exchange along a brain-wide network of perivascular spaces termed the 'glymphatic' system suggest that CSF circulation may interact intimately with glial and vascular function to regulate basic aspects of brain function. Dysfunction within this glial vascular network which is a feature of the aging and injured brain is a potentially critical link between brain injury neuroinflammation and the development of chronic neurodegeneration. Ongoing research within this field may provide a powerful new framework for understanding the common links between neurodegenerative neurovascular and neuroinflammatory disease in addition to providing potentially novel therapeutic targets for these conditions.

0,Wakefulness is driven by the widespread release of neuromodulators by the ascending arousal system. Yet it is unclear how these substances orchestrate state-dependent global changes in neuronal activity. Here we show that neuromodulators induce increases in the extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)]e) in cortical slices electrically silenced by tetrodotoxin. In vivo arousal was linked to AMPA receptor-independent elevations of [K(+)]e concomitant with decreases in [Ca(2+)]e [Mg(2+)]e [H(+)]e and the extracellular volume. Opposite natural sleep and anesthesia reduced [K(+)]e while increasing [Ca(2+)]e [Mg(2+)]e and [H(+)]e as well as the extracellular volume. Local cortical activity of sleeping mice could be readily converted to the stereotypical electroencephalography pattern of wakefulness by simply imposing a  change in the extracellular ion composition. Thus extracellular ions control the state-dependent patterns of neural activity.,10.1126/science.aad4821
0,The conservation of sleep across all animal species suggests that sleep serves a  vital function. We here report that sleep has a critical function in ensuring metabolic homeostasis. Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion and two-photon imaging in live mice we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are associated with a 60% increase in the interstitial space resulting in a striking increase in convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. In turn convective fluxes of interstitial fluid increased the rate of β-amyloid clearance during sleep. Thus the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system.,10.1126/science.1241224
0,Upon entry into the central nervous system (CNS) serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) modulates neuronal growth survival and excitability. Yet mechanisms that trigger IGF-I entry across the blood-brain barrier remain unclear. We show that neuronal activity elicited by electrical sensory or behavioral stimulation increases IGF-I input in activated regions. Entrance of serum IGF-I is triggered by diffusible messengers (i.e. ATP arachidonic acid derivatives) released during neurovascular coupling. These messengers stimulate matrix metalloproteinase-9 leading to cleavage of the IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). Cleavage of IGFBP-3 allows the passage of serum IGF-I into the CNS through an interaction with the endothelial transporter lipoprotein related receptor 1. Activity-dependent entrance of serum IGF-I into the CNS may help to explain disparate observations such as proneurogenic effects of epilepsy rehabilitatory effects of neural stimulation and modulatory effects of blood flow on brain activity.,10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.007
0,"Arguments about the function of the climbing fiber (CF) input to the cerebellar cortex have fueled a rabid debate that started over 40 years ago and continues to polarize the field to this day. The origin of the controversy can be traced back to 1969 the year David Marr published part of his dissertation work in a paper entitled ""A theory of cerebellar cortex."" In Marr's theory CFs play a key  role during the process of motor learning providing an instructive signal that serves as a ""teacher"" for the post-synaptic Purkinje cells. Although this influential idea has found its way into the mainstream a number of objections have been raised. For example several investigators have pointed out that the seemingly ""all-or-nothing"" activation of the CF input provides little information and is too ambiguous to serve as an effective instructive signal. Here we take a fresh look at these arguments in light of new evidence about the peculiar physiology of CFs. Based on recent findings we propose that at the level of an individual Purkinje cell a graded instructive signal can be effectively encoded  via pre- or post-synaptic modulation of its one and only CF input.",10.3389/fncir.2013.00115

0,Pharmacological manipulation of specific neural circuits to optimize therapeutic  index is an unrealized goal in neurology and psychiatry. AMPA receptors are important for excitatory synaptic transmission and their antagonists are antiepileptic. Although efficacious AMPA-receptor antagonists including perampanel (Fycompa) the only approved antagonist for epilepsy induce dizziness and motor impairment. We hypothesized that blockade of forebrain AMPA receptors without blocking cerebellar AMPA receptors would be antiepileptic and devoid of motor impairment. Taking advantage of an AMPA receptor auxiliary protein TARP γ-8 which is selectively expressed in the forebrain and modulates the pharmacological properties of AMPA receptors we discovered that LY3130481 selectively antagonized recombinant and native AMPA receptors containing γ-8 but not γ-2 (cerebellum) or other TARP members. Two amino acid residues unique to γ-8 determined this selectivity. We also observed antagonism of AMPA receptors expressed in hippocampal but not cerebellar tissue from an patient with epilepsy. Corresponding to this selective activity LY3130481 prevented multiple  seizure types in rats and mice and without motor side effects. These findings demonstrate the first rationally discovered molecule targeting specific neural circuitries for therapeutic advantage.,10.1038/nm.4221
0,Chronic monitoring of neuronal activity in the living brain with optical imaging  techniques became feasible owing to the continued development of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). Here we report for the first time the successful generation of transgenic marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) an important  nonhuman primate model in neurophysiological research which were engineered to express the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based family of GECIs GCaMP under control of either the CMV or the hSyn promoter. High titer lentiviral vectors were produced and injected into embryos collected from donor females. The infected embryos were then transferred to recipient females. Eight transgenic animals were born and shown to have stable and functional GCaMP expression in several different tissues. Germline transmission of the transgene was confirmed in embryos generated from two of the founder transgenic marmosets that reached sexual maturity. These embryos were implanted into six recipient females three of which became pregnant and are in advanced stages of gestation. We believe these transgenic marmosets will be invaluable non-human primate models in neuroscience allowing chronic in vivo monitoring of neural activity with functional confocal and multi-photon optical microscopy imaging of intracellular  calcium dynamics.,10.1038/srep34931
0,Working memory is thought to result from sustained neuron spiking. However computational models suggest complex dynamics with discrete oscillatory bursts. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45-100 Hz) varied in time and frequency accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at  a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35 Hz) also occurred in brief variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus gamma bursts could gate access to and prevent sensory interference with working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking not sustained activity.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.028
0,Ultrasound is among the most widely used non-invasive imaging modalities in biomedicine but plays a surprisingly small role in molecular imaging due to a lack of suitable molecular reporters on the nanoscale. Here we introduce a new class of reporters for ultrasound based on genetically encoded gas nanostructures from microorganisms including bacteria and archaea. Gas vesicles are gas-filled  protein-shelled compartments with typical widths of 45-250 nm and lengths of 100-600 nm that exclude water and are permeable to gas. We show that gas vesicles produce stable ultrasound contrast that is readily detected in vitro and in vivo that their genetically encoded physical properties enable multiple modes of imaging and that contrast enhancement through aggregation permits their use as molecular biosensors.,10.1038/nnano.2014.32

0,Loss of control over harmful drug seeking is one of the most intractable aspects  of addiction as human substance abusers continue to pursue drugs despite incurring significant negative consequences. Human studies have suggested that deficits in prefrontal cortical function and consequential loss of inhibitory control could be crucial in promoting compulsive drug use. However it remains unknown whether chronic drug use compromises cortical activity and equally important whether this deficit promotes compulsive cocaine seeking. Here we use  a rat model of compulsive drug seeking in which cocaine seeking persists in a subgroup of rats despite delivery of noxious foot shocks. We show that prolonged  cocaine self-administration decreases ex vivo intrinsic excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex which was significantly more pronounced in compulsive drug-seeking animals. Furthermore compensating for hypoactive prelimbic cortex neurons with in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking whereas optogenetic prelimbic cortex inhibition significantly increased compulsive cocaine seeking. Our results show a marked reduction in prelimbic cortex excitability in compulsive cocaine-seeking rats and that in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation decreased compulsive drug-seeking behaviours. Thus  targeted stimulation of the prefrontal cortex could serve as a promising therapy  for treating compulsive drug use.,10.1038/nature12024
0,Phenotypic screening of compound libraries is a significant trend in drug discovery yet success can be hindered by difficulties in identifying the underlying cellular targets. Current approaches rely on tethering bioactive compounds to a capture tag or surface to allow selective enrichment of interacting proteins for subsequent identification by mass spectrometry. Such methods are often constrained by ineffective capture of low affinity and low abundance targets. In addition these methods are often not compatible with living cells and therefore cannot be used to verify the pharmacological activity  of the tethered compounds. We have developed a novel chloroalkane capture tag that minimally affects compound potency in cultured cells allowing binding interactions with the targets to occur under conditions relevant to the desired cellular phenotype. Subsequent isolation of the interacting targets is achieved through rapid lysis and capture onto immobilized HaloTag protein. Exchanging the  chloroalkane tag for a fluorophore the putative targets identified by mass spectrometry can be verified for direct binding to the compound through resonance energy transfer. Using the interaction between histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA) as a model system we were able to identify and verify all the known HDAC targets of SAHA as well as two previously undescribed targets ADO and CPPED1. The discovery of ADO as a target may provide mechanistic insight into a reported connection between SAHA and Huntington's disease.,10.1021/acschembio.5b00351
0,ATM is a 350 kDa serine/threonine kinase best known for its role in DNA repair and multiple cellular homeostasis pathways. Mutation in ATM causes the disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) with clinical features including ataxia severe cerebellar atrophy and Purkinje cell loss. In a cross-species study using primary rat neurons the roundworm C. elegans and a mouse model of A-T we showed that loss of ATM induces mitochondrial dysfunction and compromised mitophagy due to NAD+ insufficiency. Remarkably NAD+ repletion mitigates both the DNA repair defect and mitochondrial dysfunction in ATM-deficient neurons. In  C. elegans NAD+ repletion can clear accumulated dysfunctional mitochondria through restoration of compromised mitophagy via upregulation of DCT-1. Thus NAD+ ties together DNA repair and mitophagy in neuroprotection and intimates immediate translational applications for A-T and related neurodegenerative DNA repair-deficient diseases.,10.1080/15548627.2016.1257467
0,Defects in mitochondrial metabolism have been increasingly linked with age-onset  protein-misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's Parkinson's and Huntington's. In response to protein-folding stress compartment-specific unfolded protein responses (UPRs) within the ER mitochondria and cytosol work in parallel to ensure cellular protein homeostasis. While perturbation of individual compartments can make other compartments more susceptible to protein stress the  cellular conditions that trigger cross-communication between the individual UPRs  remain poorly understood. We have uncovered a conserved robust mechanism linking mitochondrial protein homeostasis and the cytosolic folding environment through changes in lipid homeostasis. Metabolic restructuring caused by mitochondrial stress or small-molecule activators trigger changes in gene expression coordinated uniquely by both the mitochondrial and cytosolic UPRs protecting the cell from disease-associated proteins. Our data suggest an intricate and unique system of communication between UPRs in response to metabolic changes that could  unveil new targets for diseases of protein misfolding.,10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.027
0,The ability to reinstate neuronal assemblies representing mnemonic information is thought to require their consolidation through offline reactivation during sleep/rest. To test this we detected cell assembly patterns formed by repeated neuronal co-activations in the mouse hippocampus during exploration of spatial environments. We found that the reinstatement of assembly patterns representing a novel but not a familiar environment correlated with their offline reactivation and was impaired by closed-loop optogenetic disruption of sharp wave-ripple oscillations. Moreover we discovered that reactivation was only required for the reinstatement of assembly patterns whose expression was gradually strengthened during encoding of a novel place. The context-dependent reinstatement of assembly patterns whose expression did not gain in strength beyond the first few minutes of spatial encoding was not dependent on reactivation. This demonstrates that the hippocampus can hold concurrent representations of space that markedly differ in  their encoding dynamics and their dependence on offline reactivation for consolidation.

0,Two intermingled hypothalamic neuron populations specified by expression of agouti-related peptide (AGRP) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) positively and negatively influence feeding behavior respectively possibly by reciprocally regulating downstream melanocortin receptors. However the sufficiency of these neurons to control behavior and the relationship of their activity to the magnitude and dynamics of feeding are unknown. To measure this we used channelrhodopsin-2 for cell type-specific photostimulation. Activation of only 800 AGRP neurons in mice evoked voracious feeding within minutes. The behavioral  response increased with photoexcitable neuron number photostimulation frequency  and stimulus duration. Conversely POMC neuron stimulation reduced food intake and body weight which required melanocortin receptor signaling. However AGRP neuron-mediated feeding was not dependent on suppressing this melanocortin pathway indicating that AGRP neurons directly engage feeding circuits. Furthermore feeding was evoked selectively over drinking without training or prior photostimulus exposure which suggests that AGRP neurons serve a dedicated  role coordinating this complex behavior.,10.1038/nn.2739
0,Effective navigation requires planning extended routes to remembered goal locations. Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict  immediate future behaviour even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as  'replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed trajectory-finding mechanism which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths at specific times when memory retrieval is required and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.,10.1038/nature12112
0,Place-modulated activity among neurons in the hippocampal formation presents a means to organize contextual information in the service of memory formation and recall. One particular spatial representation that of grid cells has been observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of rats and bats but has yet to be described in single units in primates. Here we examined spatial representations in the EC of head-fixed monkeys performing a free-viewing visual memory task. Individual neurons were identified in the primate EC that emitted action potentials when the monkey fixated multiple discrete locations in the visual field in each of many sequentially presented complex images. These firing fields  possessed spatial periodicity similar to a triangular tiling with a corresponding well-defined hexagonal structure in the spatial autocorrelation. Further these neurons showed theta-band oscillatory activity and changing spatial scale as a function of distance from the rhinal sulcus which is consistent with previous findings in rodents. These spatial representations may provide a framework to anchor the encoding of stimulus content in a complex visual scene. Together our  results provide a direct demonstration of grid cells in the primate and suggest that EC neurons encode space during visual exploration even without locomotion.,10.1038/nature11587
0,The medial entorhinal cortex (EC) is a part of the neural network for the representation of self-location in the rat. The key cell type of this system is the grid cell whose multiple firing fields span the environment in a remarkably  regular triangular or hexagonal pattern. The basic properties of grid cells and other cell types have been described but the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of the place code remain elusive. These mechanisms  can be investigated by genetic intervention strategies where specific components of the entorhinal-hippocampal network are activated or silenced. Because of the common use of knockout mice for such targeted interventions we asked if grid activity is expressed also in the mouse. Principal neurons in the superficial layers of mouse medial EC had stable grid fields similar to those of the rat. Neighboring grid cells shared a common spacing and orientation but had a different spatial phase such that a small number of grid cells collectively represented all locations in the environment. The spacing of the grid increased with distance from the dorsal border of the medial EC. The lowest values for grid spacing recorded at the dorsal end were comparable to those of the rat suggesting that grid fields do not scale up proportionally with body size. Grid cells were colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive place x head-direction cells as in the rat. The demonstration of grid cells in mice prepares the ground for transgenic analyses of the entorhinal-hippocampal network.,10.1002/hipo.20472
0,Spatial navigation requires information about the relationship between current and future positions. The activity of hippocampal neurons appears to reflect such a relationship representing not only instantaneous position but also the path towards a goal location. However how the hippocampus obtains information about goal direction is poorly understood. Here we report a prefrontal-thalamic neural  circuit that is required for hippocampal representation of routes or trajectories through the environment. Trajectory-dependent firing was observed in medial prefrontal cortex the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats. Lesioning or optogenetic silencing of the nucleus reuniens substantially reduced trajectory-dependent CA1 firing. Trajectory-dependent activity was almost absent in CA3 which does not receive nucleus reuniens input. The data suggest that projections from medial prefrontal  cortex via the nucleus reuniens are crucial for representation of the future path during goal-directed behaviour and point to the thalamus as a key node in networks for long-range communication between cortical regions involved in navigation.,10.1038/nature14396
0,Grid cells are neurons with periodic spatial receptive fields (grids) that tile two-dimensional space in a hexagonal pattern. To provide useful information about location grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show  in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This together with the near-absence of rotation in novel environments suggests that the rotation emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear  forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.,10.1038/nature14151
0,The contribution of hippocampal circuits to high-capacity episodic memory is often attributed to the large number of orthogonal activity patterns that may be  stored in these networks. Evidence for high-capacity storage in the hippocampus is missing however. When animals are tested in pairs of environments different  combinations of place cells are recruited consistent with the notion of independent representations. However the extent to which representations remain  independent across larger numbers of environments has not been determined. To investigate whether spatial firing patterns recur when animals are exposed to multiple environments we tested rats in 11 recording boxes each in a different  room allowing for 55 comparisons of place maps in each animal. In each environment activity was recorded from neuronal ensembles in hippocampal area CA3 with an average of 30 active cells per animal. Representations were highly correlated between repeated tests in the same room but remained orthogonal across all combinations of different rooms with minimal overlap in the active cell samples from each environment. A low proportion of cells had activity in many rooms but the firing locations of these cells were completely uncorrelated. Taken together the results suggest that the number of independent spatial representations stored in hippocampal area CA3 is large with minimal recurrence  of spatial firing patterns across environments.,10.1073/pnas.1421056111
0,To determine how hippocampal backprojections influence spatially periodic firing  in grid cells we recorded neural activity in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)  of rats after temporary inactivation of the hippocampus. We report two major changes in entorhinal grid cells. First hippocampal inactivation gradually and selectively extinguished the grid pattern. Second the same grid cells that lost  their grid fields acquired substantial tuning to the direction of the rat's head. This transition in firing properties was contingent on a drop in the average firing rate of the grid cells and could be replicated by the removal of an external excitatory drive in an attractor network model in which grid structure emerges by velocity-dependent translation of activity across a network with inhibitory connections. These results point to excitatory drive from the hippocampus and possibly other regions as one prerequisite for the formation and translocation of grid patterns in the MEC.,10.1038/nn.3311
0,Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a  role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about  all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed but rarely analysed mixed  selectivity neurons.,10.1038/nature12160
0,Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain provide rich topographic innervation of the striatum and are central to learning and to generating actions. Despite the importance of this DA innervation it remains unclear whether and how DA neurons  are specialized on the basis of the location of their striatal target. Thus we sought to compare the function of subpopulations of DA neurons that target distinct striatal subregions in the context of an instrumental reversal learning  task. We identified key differences in the encoding of reward and choice in dopamine terminals in dorsal versus ventral striatum: DA terminals in ventral striatum responded more strongly to reward consumption and reward-predicting cues whereas DA terminals in dorsomedial striatum responded more strongly to contralateral choices. In both cases the terminals encoded a reward prediction error. Our results suggest that the DA modulation of the striatum is spatially organized to support the specialized function of the targeted subregion.,10.1038/nn.4287
0,Situations in which rewards are unexpectedly obtained or withheld represent opportunities for new learning. Often this learning includes identifying cues that predict reward availability. Unexpected rewards strongly activate midbrain dopamine neurons. This phasic signal is proposed to support learning about antecedent cues by signaling discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes  termed a reward prediction error. However it is unknown whether dopamine neuron  prediction error signaling and cue-reward learning are causally linked. To test this hypothesis we manipulated dopamine neuron activity in rats in two behavioral procedures associative blocking and extinction that illustrate the essential function of prediction errors in learning. We observed that optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery mimicking a prediction error was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited  reward-seeking behavior. Our findings establish a causal role for temporally precise dopamine neuron signaling in cue-reward learning bridging a critical gap between experimental evidence and influential theoretical frameworks.,10.1038/nn.3413
0,The ventral pallidum (VP) is posited to contribute to reward seeking by conveying upstream signals from the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Yet very little is known about how VP neuron responses contribute to behavioral responses to incentive cues. Here we recorded activity of VP neurons in a cue-driven reward-seeking task previously shown to require neural activity in the NAc. We find that VP neurons encode both learned cue value and subsequent reward seeking and that activity in VP neurons is required for robust cue-elicited reward seeking. Surprisingly the onset of VP neuron responses occurs at a shorter latency than cue-elicited responses in NAc neurons. This suggests that this VP encoding is not a passive response to signals generated in the NAc and that VP neurons integrate  sensory and motivation-related information received directly from other mesocorticolimbic inputs.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.04.037
0,"Although the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been studied intensely for decades its precise functions have remained elusive. We recently hypothesized that the OFC contains a ""cognitive map"" of task space in which the current state of the task is represented and this representation is especially critical for behavior  when states are unobservable from sensory input. To test this idea we apply pattern-classification techniques to neuroimaging data from humans performing a decision-making task with 16 states. We show that unobservable task states can be decoded from activity in OFC and decoding accuracy is related to task performance and the occurrence of individual behavioral errors. Moreover similarity between the neural representations of consecutive states correlates with behavioral accuracy in corresponding state transitions. These results support the idea that OFC represents a cognitive map of task space and establish  the feasibility of decoding state representations in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging.",10.1016/j.neuron.2016.08.019
0,Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been known to play an important role in decision making. However the exact nature of that role has remained elusive. Here we propose a unifying theory of OFC function. We hypothesize that OFC provides an abstraction of currently available information in the form of a labeling of the current task state which is used for reinforcement learning (RL) elsewhere in the brain. This function is especially critical when task states include unobservable information for instance from working memory. We use this  framework to explain classic findings in reversal learning delayed alternation  extinction and devaluation as well as more recent findings showing the effect of OFC lesions on the firing of dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) in rodents performing an RL task. In addition we generate a number of testable experimental predictions that can distinguish our theory from other accounts of OFC function.,10.1016/j.neuron.2013.11.005
0,Neural stem (NS) cells are multipotent cells defined by their capacity to proliferate and differentiate into all neuronal and glial phenotypes. NS cells can be obtained from specific regions of the adult brain or generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). NS cells differentiate into neural progenitor (NP) cells and subsequently neural precursors as transient steps towards terminal differentiation into specific mature neuronal or glial phenotypes. When cultured  in EGF and FGF2 ESC-derived NS cells have been reported to be stable and multipotent. Conditions that enable differentiation of NS cells through the committed progenitor and precursor stages to specific neuronal subtypes have not  been fully established. In this study we investigated using Lmx1a reporter ESCs whether the length of neural induction (NI) dictated the phenotypic potential of  cultures of ESC-derived NS cells or NP cells. Following 4 7 or 10 day periods of NI ESCs in monolayer culture were harvested and cultured as neurospheres prior  to replating as monolayer cultures for several passages in EGF and FGF2. The NS/NP cultures were then directed towards mature neuronal fates over 16-17 days.  4 and 7-day NS cell cultures could not be differentiated towards dopaminergic serotonergic or cholinergic fates as determined by the absence of tyrosine hydroxylase 5-HT or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunolabelling. In contrast NS/NP cultures derived after 10 days of NI were able to generate tyrosine hydroxylase and 5-HT positive neurons (24±6 and 13±1% of the βIII-tubulin positive population respectively n=3). Our data suggest that extended periods of neural induction enhanced the potential of mouse ESC-derived  NS/NP cells to generate specific subtypes of neurons. NS/NP cells derived after shorter periods of NI appeared to be lineage-restricted in relation to the neuronal subtypes observed after removal of EGF.,10.1016/j.neuint.2011.04.002
0,The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) has been described as signaling either outcome expectancies or value. Previously we used unblocking to show that lOFC neurons respond to a predictive cue signaling a 'valueless' change in outcome features (McDannald 2014). However many lOFC neurons also fired to a cue that simply signaled more reward. Here we recorded lOFC neurons in a variant of this  task in which rats learned about cues that signaled either more (upshift) less (downshift) or the same (blocked) amount of reward. We found that neurons acquired responses specifically to one of the three cues and did not fire to the  other two. These results show that at least early in learning lOFC neurons fire to valued cues in a way that is more consistent with signaling of the predicted outcome's features than with signaling of a general abstract or cached value that is independent of the outcome.,10.7554/elife.11299
0,Projections from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) innervate components of the  mesolimbic dopamine (MLDA) system including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) to modulate motivation appropriately for physiologic state. Neurotensin (NT)-containing LHA neurons respond to multiple homeostatic challenges and project to the VTA suggesting that these neurons could link such  signals to MLDA function. Indeed we found that pharmacogenetic activation of LHA NT neurons promoted prolonged DA-dependent locomotor activity and NAc DA efflux  suggesting the importance of VTA neurotransmitter release by LHA NT neurons for the control of MLDA function. Using a microdialysis-mass spectrometry technique that we developed to detect endogenous NT in extracellular fluid in the mouse brain we found that activation of LHA NT cells acutely increased the extracellular concentration of NT (a known activator of VTA DA cells) in the VTA. In contrast to the prolonged elevation of extracellular NAc DA however VTA NT concentrations rapidly returned to baseline. Intra-VTA infusion of NT receptor antagonist abrogated the ability of LHA NT cells to increase extracellular DA in  the NAc demonstrating that VTA NT promotes NAc DA release. Thus transient LHA-derived NT release in the VTA couples LHA signaling to prolonged changes in DA efflux and MLDA function.,10.1210/en.2014-1986
0,A major impediment to improving the treatment of concussion is our current inability to identify patients that will experience persistent problems after the injury. Recently brain-derived exosomes which cross the blood-brain barrier and circulate following injury have shown great potential as a noninvasive biomarker of brain recovery. However clinical use of exosomes has been constrained by their small size (30-100 nm) and the extensive sample preparation (>24 hr) needed for traditional exosome measurements. To address these challenges we developed a smartphone-enabled optofluidic platform to measure brain-derived exosomes. Sample-to-answer on our chip is 1 hour 10x faster than conventional techniques.  The key innovation is an optofluidic device that can detect enzyme amplified exosome biomarkers and is read out using a smartphone camera. Using this approach we detected and profiled GluR2+ exosomes in the post-injury state using both in vitro and murine models of concussion.,10.1038/srep31215
0,The activity of ensembles of hippocampal place cells represents a hallmark of an  animal's spatial experience. The neuronal mechanisms that enable the rapid expression of novel place cell sequences are not entirely understood. Here we report that during sleep or rest distinct sets of hippocampal temporal sequences in the rat preplay multiple corresponding novel spatial experiences with high specificity. These findings suggest that the place cell sequence of a novel spatial experience is determined in part by an online selection of a subset of  cellular firing sequences from a larger repertoire of preexisting temporal firing sequences in the hippocampal cellular assembly network that become rapidly bound  to the novel experience. We estimate that for the given context the recorded hippocampal network activity has the capacity to preplay an extended repertoire of at least 15 future spatial experiences of similar distinctiveness and complexity.,10.1073/pnas.1306031110
0,During spatial exploration hippocampal neurons show a sequential firing pattern  in which individual neurons fire specifically at particular locations along the animal's trajectory (place cells). According to the dominant model of hippocampal cell assembly activity place cell firing order is established for the first time during exploration to encode the spatial experience and is subsequently replayed during rest or slow-wave sleep for consolidation of the encoded experience. Here we report that temporal sequences of firing of place cells expressed during a novel spatial experience occurred on a significant number of occasions during the resting or sleeping period preceding the experience. This phenomenon which is called preplay occurred in disjunction with sequences of replay of a familiar experience. These results suggest that internal neuronal dynamics during resting or sleep organize hippocampal cellular assemblies into temporal sequences that contribute to the encoding of a related novel experience  occurring in the future.,10.1038/nature09633
0,Recognizing when the world changes is fundamental for normal learning. In this issue of Neuron Bradfield et al. (2013) show that cholinergic interneurons in dorsomedial striatum are critical to the process whereby new states of the world  are appropriately registered and retrieved during associative learning.,10.1016/j.neuron.2013.06.033
0,Dominant theories of hippocampal function propose that place cell representations are formed during an animal's first encounter with a novel environment and are subsequently replayed during off-line states to support consolidation and future  behaviour. Here we report that viewing the delivery of food to an unvisited portion of an environment leads to off-line pre-activation of place cells sequences corresponding to that space. Such 'preplay' was not observed for an unrewarded but otherwise similar portion of the environment. These results suggest that a hippocampal representation of a visible yet unexplored environment can be formed if the environment is of motivational relevance to the  animal. We hypothesise such goal-biased preplay may support preparation for future experiences in novel environments.,10.7554/elife.06063
0,Hippocampal replay has been hypothesized to underlie memory consolidation and navigational planning yet the involvement of grid cells in replay is unknown. During replay we found grid cells to be spatially coherent with place cells encoding locations 11 ms delayed relative to the hippocampus with directionally  modulated grid cells and forward replay exhibiting the greatest coherence with the CA1 area of the hippocampus. This suggests grid cells are engaged during the  consolidation of spatial memories to the neocortex.,10.1038/nn.4291
0,"Navigating to a safe place such as a home or nest is a fundamental behavior for all complex animals. Determining the direction to such goals is a crucial first step in navigation. Surprisingly little is known about how or where in the brain this ""goal direction signal"" is represented. In mammals ""head-direction cells"" are thought to support this process but despite 30 years of research no evidence for a goal direction representation has been reported. Here we used fMRI to record neural activity while participants made goal direction judgments based on a previously learned virtual environment. We applied multivoxel pattern  analysis to these data and found that the human entorhinal/subicular region contains a neural representation of intended goal direction. Furthermore the neural pattern expressed for a given goal direction matched the pattern expressed when simply facing that same direction. This suggests the existence of a shared neural representation of both goal and facing direction. We argue that this reflects a mechanism based on head-direction populations that simulate future goal directions during route planning. Our data further revealed that the strength of direction information predicts performance. Finally we found a dissociation between this geocentric information in the entorhinal/subicular region and egocentric direction information in the precuneus.",10.1016/j.cub.2014.11.001
0,It has been hypothesized that the brain organizes concepts into a mental map allowing conceptual relationships to be navigated in a manner similar to that of  space. Grid cells use a hexagonally symmetric code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry in the  functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a set of brain regions markedly similar to those activated during spatial navigation. This gridlike signal is consistent across sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. Our findings suggest that global relational codes may be used  to organize nonspatial conceptual representations and that these codes may have a hexagonal gridlike pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two continuous dimensions.,10.1126/science.aaf0941
0,Complex cognitive processes require sophisticated local processing but also interactions between distant brain regions. It is therefore critical to be able to study distant interactions between local computations and the neural representations they act on. Here we report two anatomically and computationally  distinct learning signals in lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and the dopaminergic ventral midbrain (VM) that predict trial-by-trial changes to a basic internal model in hippocampus. To measure local computations during learning and  their interaction with neural representations we coupled computational fMRI with trial-by-trial fMRI suppression. We find that suppression in a medial temporal lobe network changes trial-by-trial in proportion to stimulus-outcome associations. During interleaved choice trials we identify learning signals that relate to outcome type in lOFC and to reward value in VM. These intervening choice feedback signals predicted the subsequent change to hippocampal suppression suggesting a convergence of signals that update the flexible representation of stimulus-outcome associations.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.014
0,Prior experience is critical for decision-making. It enables explicit representation of potential outcomes and provides training to valuation mechanisms. However we can also make choices in the absence of prior experience  by merely imagining the consequences of a new experience. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging repetition suppression in humans we examined how neuronal representations of novel rewards can be constructed and evaluated. A likely novel experience was constructed by invoking multiple independent memories in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. This construction persisted for only a short time period during which new associations were observed between the memories for component items. Together these findings suggest that in the absence of direct experience coactivation of multiple relevant memories can provide a training signal to the valuation system that allows the consequences of new experiences to be imagined and acted on.,10.1038/nn.3515
0,Balance of cortical excitation and inhibition (EI) is thought to be disrupted in  several neuropsychiatric conditions yet it is not clear how it is maintained in  the healthy human brain. When EI balance is disturbed during learning and memory  in animal models it can be restabilized via formation of inhibitory replicas of  newly formed excitatory connections. Here we assess evidence for such selective inhibitory rebalancing in humans. Using fMRI repetition suppression we measure newly formed cortical associations in the human brain. We show that expression of these associations reduces over time despite persistence in behavior consistent  with inhibitory rebalancing. To test this we modulated excitation/inhibition balance with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Using ultra-high-field (7T) MRI and spectroscopy we show that reducing GABA allows cortical associations to be re-expressed. This suggests that in humans associative memories are stored in balanced excitatory-inhibitory ensembles that  lie dormant unless latent inhibitory connections are unmasked.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.031
0,α-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein that is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through the processes involved in the formation of amyloid fibrils. α and β-synuclein are homologous proteins found at  comparable levels in presynaptic terminals but β-synuclein has a greatly reduced  propensity to aggregate and indeed has been found to inhibit α-synuclein aggregation. In this paper we describe how sequence differences between α- and β-synuclein affect individual microscopic processes in amyloid formation. In particular we show that β-synuclein strongly suppresses both lipid-induced aggregation and secondary nucleation of α-synuclein by competing for binding sites at the surfaces of lipid vesicles and fibrils respectively. These results  suggest that β-synuclein can act as a natural inhibitor of α-synuclein aggregation by reducing both the initiation of its self-assembly and the proliferation of its aggregates.,10.1038/srep36010
0,Compulsive eating behavior is a transdiagnostic construct that is characteristic  of medical and psychiatric conditions such as forms of obesity and eating disorders. Although feeding research is moving toward a better understanding of the proposed addictive properties of food the components and the mechanisms contributing to compulsive eating are not yet clearly defined or understood. Current understanding highlights three elements of compulsive behavior as it applies to pathological overeating: (1) habitual overeating; (2) overeating to relieve a negative emotional state; and (3) overeating despite aversive consequences. These elements emerge through mechanisms involving pathological habit formation through an aberrant learning process the emergence of a negative emotional state and dysfunctions in behavioral control. Dysfunctions in systems  within neurocircuitries that comprise the basal ganglia the extended amygdala and the prefrontal cortex result in compulsive eating behaviors. Here we present evidence to relate compulsive eating behavior and addiction and to characterize their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A major need to improve understanding of compulsive eating through the integration of complex motivational emotional and cognitive constructs is warranted.,10.1038/npp.2016.269
0,By dividing asymmetrically stem cells can generate two daughter cells with distinct fates. However evidence is limited in mammalian systems for the selective apportioning of subcellular contents between daughters. We followed the fates of old and young organelles during the division of human mammary stemlike cells and found that such cells apportion aged mitochondria asymmetrically between daughter cells. Daughter cells that received fewer old mitochondria maintained stem cell traits. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission disrupted both the age-dependent subcellular localization and segregation of mitochondria and caused loss of stem cell properties in the progeny cells. Hence mechanisms exist for mammalian stemlike cells to asymmetrically sort aged and young mitochondria  and these are important for maintaining stemness properties.,10.1126/science.1260384
0,"Great advances have been made in signaling information on brain activity in individuals or passing between an individual and a computer or robot. These include recording of natural activity using implants under the scalp or by external means or the reverse feeding of such data into the brain. In one recent  example noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allowed feeding of digitalized information into the central nervous system (CNS). Thus noninvasive  electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of motor signals at the scalp representing specific motor intention of hand moving in individual humans were fed as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at a maximum intensity of 2.0[Formula: see text]T through a circular magnetic coil placed flush on each  of the heads of subjects present at a different location. The TMS was said to induce an electric current influencing axons of the motor cortex causing the intended hand movement: the first example of the transfer of motor intention and  its expression between the brains of two remote humans. However to date the mechanisms involved not least that relating to the participation of magnetic induction remain unclear. In general in animal biology magnetic fields are usually the poor relation of neuronal current: generally ""unseen"" and if apparent disregarded or just given a nod. Niels Bohr searched for a biological parallel to complementary phenomena of physics. Pertinently the two-brains hypothesis (TBH) proposed recently that advanced animals especially man have two brains i.e. the animal CNS evolved as two fundamentally different though interdependent complementary organs: one electro-ionic (tangible known and accessible) and the other electromagnetic (intangible and difficult to access) - a stable structured and functional 3D compendium of variously induced  interacting electro-magnetic (EM) fields. Research on the CNS in health and disease progresses including that on brain-brain brain-computer and brain-robot  engineering. As they grow even closer these disciplines involve their own unique complexities including direction by the laws of inductive physics. So the novel  TBH hypothesis has wide fundamental implications including those related to TMS. These require rethinking and renewed research engaging the fully complementary equivalence of mutual magnetic and electric field induction in the CNS and within this context a new mathematics of the brain to decipher higher cognitive  operations not possible with current brain-brain and brain-machine interfaces. Bohr may now rest.",10.1142/s0219635215500235
0,The human cerebral cortex develops through an elaborate succession of cellular events that when disrupted can lead to neuropsychiatric disease. The ability to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent cells that can be differentiated in vitro provides a unique opportunity to study normal and abnormal corticogenesis.  Here we present a simple and reproducible 3D culture approach for generating a laminated cerebral cortex-like structure named human cortical spheroids (hCSs)  from pluripotent stem cells. hCSs contain neurons from both deep and superficial  cortical layers and map transcriptionally to in vivo fetal development. These neurons are electrophysiologically mature display spontaneous activity are surrounded by nonreactive astrocytes and form functional synapses. Experiments in acute hCS slices demonstrate that cortical neurons participate in network activity and produce complex synaptic events. These 3D cultures should allow a detailed interrogation of human cortical development function and disease and may prove a versatile platform for generating other neuronal and glial subtypes in vitro.,10.1038/nmeth.3415
0,Two-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) also known as real-time RT-PCR kinetic RT-PCR or quantitative fluorescent RT-PCR has become the method of choice for gene expression analysis during the last few years. It is a fast and convenient PCR method that combines traditional RT-PCR with the phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using fluorogenic primers. The detection of changes in fluorescence intensity during the reaction enables the user to follow the PCR reaction in real time.RT-qPCR comprises several steps: (1) RNA is isolated from target tissue/cells; (2) mRNA is reverse-transcribed to cDNA; (3) modified gene-specific PCR primers are used to amplify a segment of the cDNA of interest following the reaction in real time; and (4) the initial concentration of the selected transcript in a specific tissue or cell type is calculated from the exponential phase of the reaction. Relative quantification or absolute quantification compared to standards that are run in parallel can be performed.This chapter describes the entire procedure from isolation of total RNA from liver and fatty tissues/cells to the use of RT-qPCR to study gene expression in these tissues. We perform relative quantification of transcripts to calculate  the fold-difference of a certain mRNA level between different samples. In addition tips for choosing primers and performing analyses are provided to help  the beginner in understanding the technique.,10.1007/978-1-60327-369-5_2
0,Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to suppress microRNAs thereby increasing the translation and stability of the targets of such microRNAs. In this review we discuss the emerging functions of circRNAs including RNA transcription splicing turnover and translation. We also discuss other possible facets of circRNAs that can influence their function  depending on the cell context such as circRNA abundance subcellular localization interacting partners (RNA DNA and proteins) dynamic changes in interactions following stimulation and potential circRNA translation. The ensuing changes in gene expression patterns elicited by circRNAs are proposed to  drive key cellular processes such as cell proliferation differentiation and survival that govern health and disease.

0,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Repeated administration of a μ opioid receptor agonist can enhance some forms of impulsivity such as delay discounting. However it is  unclear whether repeated administration alters motor impulsivity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We examined the effects of acute administration of morphine and amphetamine prior to and during daily morphine administration in rats responding under a five-choice serial reaction time task. Rats (n = 5) were  trained to detect a brief flash of light presented randomly in one of five response holes; responding in the target hole delivered food whereas responding  in the wrong hole or responding prior to illumination of the target stimulus (premature response) initiated a timeout. Premature responding served as an index of motor impulsivity. KEY RESULTS: Administered acutely morphine (0.1-10 mg·kg(-1)  i.p.) increased omissions and modestly although not significantly premature responding without  affecting response accuracy; amphetamine (0.1-1.78 mg·kg(-1)  i.p.) increased premature responding without changing omissions or response accuracy. After 3 weeks of 10 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1) morphine tolerance developed to its effects on  omissions whereas premature responding increased approximately fourfold compared with baseline. Effects of amphetamine were not significantly affected by daily morphine administration. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that repeated administration of  morphine increased effects of morphine on motor impulsivity although tolerance developed to other effects such as omissions. To the extent that impulsivity is  a risk factor for drug abuse repeated administration of μ opioid receptor agonists for recreational or therapeutic purposes might increase impulsivity and thus the risk for drug abuse.,10.1111/bph.13434
0,Individuals from different populations vary considerably in their susceptibility  to immune-related diseases. To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. A total of 9.3% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 804 genes more than 75% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting expression  quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Finally we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent population-specific signatures  of adaptation. Together our results demonstrate how historical selective events  continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today including for traits that are key to controlling infection.,10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.025
0,The functional rules for microRNA (miRNA) targeting remain controversial despite  their biological importance because only a small fraction of distinct interactions called site types have been examined among an astronomical number  of site types that can occur between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. To systematically discover functional site types and to evaluate the contradicting rules reported previously we used large-scale transcriptome data and statistically examined whether each of approximately 2 billion site types is enriched in differentially downregulated mRNAs responding to overexpressed miRNAs. Accordingly we identified seven non-canonical functional site types most of which are novel in addition to four canonical site types while also removing numerous false positives reported by previous studies. Extensive experimental validation and significantly elevated 3' UTR sequence conservation indicate that these non-canonical site types may have biologically relevant roles. Our expanded catalog of functional site types suggests that the gene regulatory network controlled by miRNAs may be far more complex than currently understood.,10.1038/ng.3694
0,"Histone-modifying enzymes regulate transcription and are sensitive to availability of endogenous small-molecule metabolites allowing chromatin to respond to changes in environment. The gut microbiota produces a myriad of metabolites that affect host physiology and susceptibility to disease; however the underlying molecular events remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that  microbial colonization regulates global histone acetylation and methylation in multiple host tissues in a diet-dependent manner: consumption of a ""Western-type"" diet prevents many of the microbiota-dependent chromatin changes that occur in a  polysaccharide-rich diet. Finally we demonstrate that supplementation of germ-free mice with short-chain fatty acids major products of gut bacterial fermentation is sufficient to recapitulate chromatin modification states and transcriptional responses associated with colonization. These findings have profound implications for understanding the complex functional interactions between diet gut microbiota and host health.",10.1016/j.molcel.2016.10.025
0,Systemic arterial hypertension is an important cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension in fact the incidence prevalence and severity of hypertension is  highest among African American (AA) women. Previous data suggests that differential gene expression influences individual susceptibility to selected diseases and we hypothesized that this phenomena may affect health disparities in hypertension. Transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AA or white normotensive or hypertensive females identified thousands of mRNAs differentially-expressed by race and/or hypertension. Predominant gene expression differences were observed in AA hypertensive females compared to AA normotensives or white hypertensives. Since microRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression we profiled global microRNA expression and observed differentially-expressed microRNAs by race and/or hypertension. We identified novel mRNA-microRNA pairs potentially involved in hypertension-related pathways and differently-expressed including MCL1/miR-20a-5p APOL3/miR-4763-5p PLD1/miR-4717-3p and PLD1/miR-4709-3p. We validated gene expression levels via RT-qPCR and microRNA target validation was performed in primary endothelial cells. Altogether we identified significant gene expression differences between  AA and white female hypertensives and pinpointed novel mRNA-microRNA pairs differentially-expressed by hypertension and race. These differences may contribute to the known disparities in hypertension and may be potential targets  for intervention.,10.1038/srep35815
0,"PURPOSE: African Americans (AA) exhibit higher rates of prostate cancer incidence and mortality compared with European American (EA) men. In addition to socioeconomic influences biologic factors are believed to play a critical role in prostate cancer disparities. We investigated whether population-specific and -enriched miRNA-mRNA interactions might contribute to prostate cancer disparities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Integrative genomics was used combining miRNA and mRNA profiling miRNA target prediction pathway analysis and functional validation  to map miRNA-mRNA interactions associated with prostate cancer disparities. RESULTS: We identified 22 AA-specific and 18 EA-specific miRNAs in prostate cancer versus patient-matched normal prostate and 10 ""AA-enriched/-depleted"" miRNAs in AA prostate cancer versus EA prostate cancer comparisons. Many of these population-specific/-enriched miRNAs could be paired with target mRNAs that exhibited an inverse pattern of differential expression. Pathway analysis revealed EGFR (or ERBB) signaling as a critical pathway significantly regulated by AA-specific/-enriched mRNAs and miRNA-mRNA pairings. Novel miRNA-mRNA pairings were validated by qRT-PCR Western blot and/or IHC analyses in prostate cancer specimens. Loss/gain of function assays performed in population-specific prostate cancer cell lines confirmed miR-133a/MCL1 miR-513c/STAT1 miR-96/FOXO3A miR-145/ITPR2 and miR-34a/PPP2R2A as critical miRNA-mRNA pairings driving oncogenesis. Manipulating the balance of these pairings resulted in decreased proliferation and invasion and enhanced sensitization to docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in AA prostate cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that AA-specific/-enriched miRNA-mRNA pairings may  play a critical role in the activation of oncogenic pathways in AA prostate cancer. Our findings also suggest that miR-133a/MCL1 miR-513c/STAT1 and miR-96/FOXO3A may have clinical significance in the development of novel strategies for treating aggressive prostate cancer.",10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-14-1566
0,Hyperglycemia and hypertension impair endothelial function in part through oxidative stress-activated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Biguanides and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as metformin and telmisartan have a  vascular protective effect. We used cultured vascular endothelial cells (ECs) diabetic and hypertensive rodent models and AMPKα2-knockout mice to investigate  whether metformin and telmisartan have a beneficial effect on the endothelium via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation of PARP1 and thus inhibition  of PARP1 activity. The results showed that metformin and telmisartan but not glipizide and metoprolol activated AMPK which phosphorylated PARP1 Ser-177 in cultured ECs and the vascular wall of rodent models. Experiments using phosphorylated/de-phosphorylated PARP1 mutants show that AMPK phosphorylation of  PARP1 leads to decreased PARP1 activity and attenuated protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) but increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog  1 (SIRT1) expression. Taken together the data presented here suggest biguanides  and ARBs have a beneficial effect on the vasculature by the cascade of AMPK phosphorylation of PARP1 to inhibit PARP1 activity and protein PARylation in ECs thereby mitigating endothelial dysfunction.,10.1371/journal.pone.0151845
0,The study of human consciousness has historically depended on introspection. However introspection is constrained by what can be remembered and verbalized. Here we demonstrate the utility of high temporal resolution pupillometry to track the locus of conscious attention dynamically over a single trial. While eye-tracked participants heard several musical clips played diotically (same music in each ear) and later dichotically (two clips played simultaneously one in each ear). During dichotic presentation participants attended to only one ear. We found that the temporal pattern of pupil dilation dynamics over a single  trial discriminated which piece of music was consciously attended on dichotic trials. Deconvolving these pupillary responses further revealed the real-time changes in stimulus salience motivating pupil dilation. Taken together these results show that pupil dilation patterns during single-exposure to dynamic stimuli can be exploited to discern the contents of conscious attention.,10.1016/j.concog.2015.05.001
0,The present study demonstrates that humans' response to a single stimulus (S1) is determined by what follows S1's associates. The experiment used a sensory preconditioning (SPC) design where S1 was associated with both S2 and S3 on separate trials before establishing relationships between these latter stimuli with an outcome or its absence in a second phase. When S2 and S3 were associated  with the same consequence either an outcome or its absence strong consequence-based responding to S1 was observed in a reaction time test. Participants responded quickly to indicate that the outcome was or was not predicted by S1. When S2 predicted the outcome and S3 did not SPC was weaker although participants were not slower to respond to S1. Implications on the understanding of the mechanisms that allow for the response to S1 to emerge are discussed.,10.1016/j.beproc.2014.09.034
0,Dopamine neurons are thought to signal reward prediction error or the difference between actual and predicted reward. How dopamine neurons jointly encode this information however remains unclear. One possibility is that different neurons  specialize in different aspects of prediction error; another is that each neuron  calculates prediction error in the same way. We recorded from optogenetically identified dopamine neurons in the lateral ventral tegmental area (VTA) while mice performed classical conditioning tasks. Our tasks allowed us to determine the full prediction error functions of dopamine neurons and compare them to each  other. We found marked homogeneity among individual dopamine neurons: their responses to both unexpected and expected rewards followed the same function just scaled up or down. As a result we were able to describe both individual and population responses using just two parameters. Such uniformity ensures robust information coding allowing each dopamine neuron to contribute fully to the prediction error signal.,10.1038/nn.4239
0,Hippocampal replay during sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) is thought to drive memory consolidation in hippocampal and cortical circuits. Changes in neocortical activity can precede SWR events but whether and how these changes influence the  content of replay remains unknown. Here we show that during sleep there is a rapid cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of information flow around the times of  SWRs. We recorded neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampus of rats as they learned a sound-guided task and during sleep. We found that patterned activation in AC precedes and predicts the subsequent content of hippocampal activity during SWRs while hippocampal patterns during SWRs predict subsequent AC activity. Delivering sounds during sleep biased AC activity patterns and sound-biased AC patterns predicted subsequent hippocampal activity. These findings suggest that activation of specific cortical representations during sleep influences the identity of the memories that are consolidated into long-term stores.,10.1038/nn.4457
0,Encoding of behavioral episodes as spike sequences during hippocampal theta oscillations provides a neural substrate for computations on events extended across time and space. However the mechanisms underlying the numerous and diverse experimentally observed properties of theta sequences remain poorly understood. Here we account for theta sequences using a novel model constrained by the septo-hippocampal circuitry. We show that when spontaneously active interneurons integrate spatial signals and theta frequency pacemaker inputs they generate phase precessing action potentials that can coordinate theta sequences in place cell populations. We reveal novel constraints on sequence generation predict cellular properties and neural dynamics that characterize sequence compression identify circuit organization principles for high capacity sequential representation and show that theta sequences can be used as substrates for association of conditioned stimuli with recent and upcoming events. Our results suggest mechanisms for flexible sequence compression that are suited to associative learning across an animal's lifespan.,10.7554/elife.20349
0,Changes in gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However the relationship between gamma oscillations and  cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz) but not other frequencies reduces levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)1-40 and Aβ 1-42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Aβ. Subsequently we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.,10.1038/nature20587
0,Imagining future events conveys adaptive benefits yet recurrent simulations of feared situations may help to maintain anxiety. In two studies we tested the hypothesis that people can attenuate future fears by suppressing anticipatory simulations of dreaded events. Participants repeatedly imagined upsetting episodes that they feared might happen to them and suppressed imaginings of other such events. Suppressing imagination engaged the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which modulated activation in the hippocampus and in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Consistent with the role of the vmPFC in providing access to details that are typical for an event stronger inhibition of this region was associated with greater forgetting of such details. Suppression further hindered participants' ability to later freely envision suppressed episodes. Critically it also reduced feelings of apprehensiveness about the feared scenario and individuals who were particularly successful at down-regulating fears were also less trait-anxious. Attenuating apprehensiveness  by suppressing simulations of feared events may thus be an effective coping strategy suggesting that a deficiency in this mechanism could contribute to the  development of anxiety.,10.1073/pnas.1606604114
0,"The hippocampus has been implicated in integrating information across separate events in support of mnemonic generalizations. These generalizations may be underpinned by processes at both encoding (linking similar information across events) and retrieval (""on-the-fly"" generalization). However the relative contribution of the hippocampus to encoding- and retrieval-based generalizations  is poorly understood. Using fMRI in humans we investigated the hippocampal role  in gradually learning a set of spatial discriminations and subsequently generalizing them in an acquired equivalence task. We found a highly significant  correlation between individuals' performance on a generalization test and hippocampal activity during the test providing evidence that hippocampal processes support on-the-fly generalizations at retrieval. Within the same hippocampal region there was also a correlation between activity during the final stage of learning (when all associations had been learnt but no generalization was required) and subsequent generalization performance. We suggest that the hippocampus spontaneously retrieves prior events that share overlapping features  with the current event. This process may also support the creation of generalized representations during encoding. These findings are supportive of the view that the hippocampus contributes to both encoding- and retrieval-based generalization  via the same basic mechanism; retrieval of similar events sharing common features. © 2016 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals Inc.",10.1002/hipo.22688
0,In addition to dopamine neurons the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contains GABA- glutamate- and co-releasing neurons and recent reports suggest a complex role for the glutamate neurons in behavioural reinforcement. We report that optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons or terminals serves as a positive reinforcer on operant behavioural assays. Mice display marked preference for brief over sustained VTA glutamate neuron stimulation resulting in behavioural responses that are notably distinct from dopamine neuron stimulation  and resistant to dopamine receptor antagonists. Whole-cell recordings reveal EPSCs following stimulation of VTA glutamate terminals in the nucleus accumbens or local VTA collaterals; but reveal both excitatory and monosynaptic inhibitory  currents in the ventral pallidum and lateral habenula though the net effects on  postsynaptic firing in each region are consistent with the observed rewarding behavioural effects. These data indicate that VTA glutamate neurons co-release GABA in a projection-target-dependent manner and that their transient activation  drives positive reinforcement.,10.1038/ncomms13697
0,"Peripheral sensory organs provide the first transformation of sensory information and understanding how their physical embodiment shapes transduction  is central to understanding perception. We report the characterization of surface transduction during active sensing in the rodent vibrissa sensory system a widely used model. Employing high-speed videography we tracked vibrissae while rats sampled rough and smooth textures. Variation in vibrissa length predicted motion mean frequencies including for the highest velocity events indicating that biomechanics such as vibrissa resonance shape signals most likely to drive neural activity. Rough surface contact generated large amplitude high-velocity ""stick-slip-ring"" events while smooth surfaces generated smaller and more regular stick-slip oscillations. Both surfaces produced velocities exceeding those applied in reduced preparations indicating active sensation of surfaces generates more robust drive than previously predicted. These findings demonstrate a key role for embodiment in vibrissal sensing and the importance of input transformations in sensory representation.",10.1016/j.neuron.2007.12.024
0,Mural cells (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) play an essential role in the development of the vasculature promoting vascular quiescence and long-term vessel stabilization through their interactions with endothelial cells. However the mechanistic details of how mural cells stabilize vessels are not fully understood. We have examined the emergence and functional role of mural cells investing the dorsal aorta during early development using the zebrafish. Consistent with previous literature our data suggest that cells ensheathing the  dorsal aorta emerge from a sub-population of cells in the adjacent sclerotome. Inhibition of mural cell recruitment to the dorsal aorta through disruption of pdgfr signaling leads to a reduced vascular basement membrane which in turn results in enhanced dorsal aorta vessel elasticity and failure to restrict aortic diameter. Our results provide direct in vivo evidence for a functional role for mural cells in patterning and stabilization of the early vasculature through production and maintenance of the vascular basement membrane to prevent abnormal  aortic expansion and elasticity.,10.1242/dev.143131
0,We developed a personalized cancer vaccine in which patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are fused with autologous dendritic cells generating a hybridoma that potently stimulates broad antitumor responses. We report results obtained from the first 17 AML patients who achieved remission after chemotherapy and were then serially vaccinated to target minimal residual disease and prevent relapse. Vaccination was well tolerated and induced inflammatory responses at the site of administration characterized by the dense infiltration  of T cells. Vaccination was also associated with a marked rise in circulating T cells recognizing whole AML cells and leukemia-specific antigens that persisted for more than 6 months. Twelve of 17 vaccinated patients (71%; 90% confidence interval 52 to 89%) remain alive without recurrence at a median follow-up of 57  months. The results demonstrate that personalized vaccination of AML patients in  remission induces the expansion of leukemia-specific T cells and may be protective against disease relapse.,10.1126/scitranslmed.aag1298
0,Our sense of time is far from constant. For instance time flies when we are having fun and it slows to a trickle when we are bored. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been implicated in variable time estimation. However a direct link  between signals carried by dopamine neurons and temporal judgments is lacking. We measured and manipulated the activity of dopamine neurons as mice judged the duration of time intervals. We found that pharmacogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons decreased behavioral sensitivity to time and that dopamine neurons encoded information about trial-to-trial variability in time estimates. Last we  found that transient activation or inhibition of dopamine neurons was sufficient  to slow down or speed up time estimation respectively. Dopamine neuron activity  thus reflects and can directly control the judgment of time.,10.1126/science.aah5234
0,Habits and rituals are expressed universally across animal species. These behaviors are advantageous in allowing sequential behaviors to be performed without cognitive overload and appear to rely on neural circuits that are relatively benign but vulnerable to takeover by extreme contexts neuropsychiatric sequelae and processes leading to addiction. Reinforcement learning (RL) is thought to underlie the formation of optimal habits. However this theoretic formulation has principally been tested experimentally in simple stimulus-response tasks with relatively few available responses. We asked whether RL could also account for the emergence of habitual action sequences in realistically complex situations in which no repetitive stimulus-response links were present and in which many response options were present. We exposed naïve macaque monkeys to such experimental conditions by introducing a unique free saccade scan task. Despite the highly uncertain conditions and no instruction the monkeys developed a succession of stereotypical self-chosen saccade sequence patterns. Remarkably these continued to morph for months long after session-averaged reward and cost (eye movement distance) reached asymptote. Prima facie these continued behavioral changes appeared to challenge RL. However trial-by-trial analysis showed that pattern changes on adjacent trials were predicted by lowered cost and RL simulations that reduced the cost reproduced the monkeys' behavior. Ultimately the patterns settled into stereotypical saccade sequences that minimized the cost of obtaining the reward on average. These findings suggest that brain mechanisms underlying the emergence of habits  and perhaps unwanted repetitive behaviors in clinical disorders could follow RL  algorithms capturing extremely local explore/exploit tradeoffs.,10.1073/pnas.1013470107
0,Local fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal serve as the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Understanding the correlation between distinct aspects of neural activity and the BOLD response is  fundamental to the interpretation of this widely used mapping signal. Analysis of this question requires the ability to precisely manipulate the activity of defined neurons. To achieve such control we combined optogenetic drive of neocortical neurons with high-resolution (9.4 T) rodent fMRI and detailed analysis of neurophysiological data. Light-driven activation of pyramidal neurons resulted in a positive BOLD response at the stimulated site. To help differentiate the neurophysiological correlate(s) of the BOLD response we employed light trains of the same average frequency but with periodic and Poisson distributed pulse times. These different types of pulse trains generated  dissociable patterns of single-unit multi-unit and local field potential (LFP) activity and of BOLD signals. The BOLD activity exhibited the strongest correlation to spiking activity with increasing rates of stimulation and to a first approximation was linear with pulse delivery rate while LFP activity showed a weaker correlation. These data provide an example of a strong correlation between spike rate and the BOLD response.

0,The hippocampus plays an important role in memory for events that are distinct in space and time. One of the strongest most synchronous neural signals produced by the hippocampus is the sharp-wave ripple (SWR) observed in a variety of mammalian species during offline behaviors such as slow-wave sleep [1-3] and quiescent waking and pauses in exploration [4-8] leading to long-standing and widespread theories of its contribution to plasticity and memory during these inactive or immobile states [9-14]. Indeed during sleep and waking inactivity hippocampal SWRs in rodents appear to support spatial long-term and working memory [4 15-23] but so far they have not been linked to memory in primates. More recently SWRs have been observed during active visual scene exploration in macaques [24] opening up the possibility that these active-state ripples in the  primate hippocampus are linked to memory for objects embedded in scenes. By measuring hippocampal SWRs in macaques during search for scene-contextualized objects we found that SWR rate increased with repeated presentations. Furthermore gaze during SWRs was more likely to be near the target object on repeated than on novel presentations even after accounting for overall differences in gaze location with scene repetition. This proximity bias with repetition occurred near the time of target object detection for remembered targets. The increase in ripple likelihood near remembered visual objects suggests a link between ripples and memory in primates; specifically SWRs may reflect part of a mechanism supporting the guidance of search based on past experience.,10.1016/j.cub.2016.11.027

0,The presence and relative stability of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in biofluids has led to an emerging recognition of their promise as 'liquid biopsies' for diseases. Most prior studies on discovery of exRNAs as disease-specific biomarkers have focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) using technologies such as qRT-PCR  and microarrays. The recent application of next-generation sequencing to discovery of exRNA biomarkers has revealed the presence of potential novel miRNAs as well as other RNA species such as tRNAs snoRNAs piRNAs and lncRNAs in biofluids. At the same time the use of RNA sequencing for biofluids poses unique challenges including low amounts of input RNAs the presence of exRNAs in different compartments with varying degrees of vulnerability to isolation techniques and the high abundance of specific RNA species (thereby limiting the  sensitivity of detection of less abundant species). Moreover discovery in human  diseases often relies on archival biospecimens of varying age and limiting amounts of samples. In this study we have tested RNA isolation methods to optimize profiling exRNAs by RNA sequencing in individuals without any known diseases. Our findings are consistent with other recent studies that detect microRNAs and ribosomal RNAs as the major exRNA species in plasma. Similar to other recent studies we found that the landscape of biofluid microRNA transcriptome is dominated by several abundant microRNAs that appear to comprise  conserved extracellular miRNAs. There is reasonable correlation of sets of conserved miRNAs across biological replicates and even across other data sets obtained at different investigative sites. Conversely the detection of less abundant miRNAs is far more dependent on the exact methodology of RNA isolation and profiling. This study highlights the challenges in detecting and quantifying  less abundant plasma miRNAs in health and disease using RNA sequencing platforms.,10.1371/journal.pone.0164644
0,We argue that bidirectional interaction between animal and human studies is essential for understanding the human brain.

0,The vegetative state and other so-called disorders of consciousness present some  of the most significant practical and ethical challenges in modern medicine. It is extremely difficult to assess residual cognitive function in these patients because their movements may be minimal or inconsistent or because no cognitive output may be possible. In recent years behavioral and neuroimaging techniques developed within the cognitive neurosciences have provided a number of new approaches for investigating these disorders leading to significant advances in  current understanding. In several cases residual cognitive function and even conscious awareness have been demonstrated in patients who are assumed to be vegetative yet retain cognitive abilities that have evaded detection using standard clinical methods. In this article I review these data focusing primarily on the vegetative and minimally conscious states.,10.1196/annals.1440.013

0,A promising therapeutic strategy for diverse genetic disorders involves transplantation of autologous stem cells that have been genetically corrected ex  vivo. A major challenge in such approaches is a loss of stem cell potency during  culture. Here we describe an artificial niche for maintaining muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vitro in a potent quiescent state. Using a machine learning method we identified a molecular signature of quiescence and used it to screen for factors that could maintain mouse MuSC quiescence thus defining a quiescence medium (QM). We also engineered muscle fibers that mimic the native myofiber of the MuSC niche. Mouse MuSCs maintained in QM on engineered fibers showed enhanced potential for engraftment tissue regeneration and self-renewal after transplantation in mice. An artificial niche adapted to human cells similarly extended the quiescence of human MuSCs in vitro and enhanced their potency in vivo. Our approach for maintaining quiescence may be applicable to stem cells isolated from other tissues.,10.1038/nbt.3576

0,Neurovascular coupling is an important control mechanism in CBF regulation. New insights into the integrated relationship between synaptic activity astrocytes Ca(2+)  and cerebral blood vessels using two-photon fluorescence imaging are slowly emerging. Here we provide a brief overview of the current understandings  and controversies regarding astrocytes in activity-dependent vasodilation. We highlight the key advantages and disadvantages of the in vitro and in vivo methodologies used to study this topic. In particular we emphasize some of the drawbacks of acute brain slices as well as the confounding effects of anesthesia  in in vivo preparations. To overcome these limitations we discuss an emerging and important trend in imaging cell Ca(2+) and blood flow control in awake and behaving animals. This new approach may help resolve existing controversies on astrocyte control of arteriole diameter by providing a more physiologically relevant preparation to study CBF regulation.,10.1111/micc.12188

0,It has long been posited that detectability of sensory inputs can be sacrificed in favor of improved discriminability and that sensory adaptation may mediate this trade-off. The extent to which this trade-off exists behaviorally and the complete picture of the underlying neural representations that likely subserve the phenomenon remain unclear. In the rodent vibrissa system an ideal observer analysis of cortical activity measured using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in anesthetized animals was combined with behavioral detection and discrimination tasks thalamic recordings from awake animals and computational modeling to show that spatial discrimination performance was improved following adaptation but at the expense of the ability to detect weak stimuli. Together these results provide direct behavioral evidence for the trade-off between detectability and discriminability that this trade-off can be modulated through bottom-up sensory  adaptation and that these effects correspond to important changes in thalamocortical coding properties.,10.1016/j.neuron.2014.01.025
0,We examine the dynamics of a neural code in the context of stimuli whose statistical properties are themselves evolving dynamically. Adaptation to these statistics occurs over a wide range of timescales-from tens of milliseconds to minutes. Rapid components of adaptation serve to optimize the information that action potentials carry about rapid stimulus variations within the local statistical ensemble while changes in the rate and statistics of action-potential firing encode information about the ensemble itself thus resolving potential ambiguities. The speed with which information is optimized and ambiguities are resolved approaches the physical limit imposed by statistical sampling and noise.,10.1038/35090500
0,A major technological goal in neuroscience is to enable the interrogation of individual cells across the live brain. By creating a curved glass replacement to the dorsal cranium and surgical methods for its installation we developed a chronic mouse preparation providing optical access to an estimated 800000-1100000 individual neurons across the dorsal surface of neocortex. Post-surgical histological studies revealed comparable glial activation as in control mice. In behaving mice expressing a Ca2+ indicator in cortical pyramidal neurons we performed Ca2+ imaging across neocortex using an epi-fluorescence macroscope and estimated that 25000-50000 individual neurons were accessible per mouse across multiple focal planes. Two-photon microscopy revealed dendritic morphologies throughout neocortex allowed time-lapse imaging of individual cells and yielded estimates of >1 million accessible neurons per mouse by serial tiling. This approach supports a variety of optical techniques and enables studies of cells across >30 neocortical areas in behaving mice.,10.1016/j.celrep.2016.12.004
0,The coordination of activity across neocortical areas is essential for mammalian  brain function. Understanding this process requires simultaneous functional measurements across the cortex. In order to dissociate direct cortico-cortical interactions from other sources of neuronal correlations it is furthermore desirable to target cross-areal recordings to neuronal subpopulations that anatomically project between areas. Here we combined anatomical tracers with a novel multi-area two-photon microscope to perform simultaneous calcium imaging across mouse primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory whisker cortex during  texture discrimination behavior specifically identifying feedforward and feedback neurons. We find that coordination of S1-S2 activity increases during motor behaviors such as goal-directed whisking and licking. This effect was not specific to identified feedforward and feedback neurons. However these mutually  projecting neurons especially participated in inter-areal coordination when motor behavior was paired with whisker-texture touches suggesting that direct S1-S2 interactions are sensory-dependent. Our results demonstrate specific functional coordination of anatomically-identified projection neurons across sensory cortices.,10.7554/elife.14679
0,Human neocortical 15-29-Hz beta oscillations are strong predictors of perceptual  and motor performance. However the mechanistic origin of beta in vivo is unknown hindering understanding of its functional role. Combining human magnetoencephalography (MEG) computational modeling and laminar recordings in animals we present a new theory that accounts for the origin of spontaneous neocortical beta. In our MEG data spontaneous beta activity from somatosensory and frontal cortex emerged as noncontinuous beta events typically lasting <150 ms with a stereotypical waveform. Computational modeling uniquely designed to infer  the electrical currents underlying these signals showed that beta events could emerge from the integration of nearly synchronous bursts of excitatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons where the defining feature of a beta event was a strong distal drive that lasted one beta period (∼50 ms). This beta mechanism rigorously accounted for the beta event profiles; several other mechanisms did not. The spatial location of synaptic drive in the model to supragranular and infragranular layers was critical to the  emergence of beta events and led to the prediction that beta events should be associated with a specific laminar current profile. Laminar recordings in somatosensory neocortex from anesthetized mice and awake monkeys supported these  predictions suggesting this beta mechanism is conserved across species and recording modalities. These findings make several predictions about optimal states for perceptual and motor performance and guide causal interventions to modulate beta for optimal function.,10.1073/pnas.1604135113
0,Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to prevent the development of liver fibrosis in a number of pre-clinical studies. Marked changes in liver histopathology and serological markers of liver function have been observed without a clear understanding of the therapeutic mechanism by which stem cells act. We sought to determine if MSCs could modulate the activity of resident liver cells specifically hepatic stellate cells (SCs) by paracrine mechanisms using indirect cocultures. Indirect coculture of MSCs and activated SCs led to a significant decrease in collagen deposition and proliferation while inducing apoptosis of activated SCs. The molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of SC activity by MSCs were examined. IL-6 secretion from activated SCs induced IL-10 secretion from MSCs suggesting a dynamic response of MSCs to the SCs in the microenvironment. Blockade of MSC-derived IL-10 and TNF-alpha abolished the inhibitory effects of MSCs on SC proliferation and collagen synthesis. In addition release of HGF by MSCs was responsible for the marked induction of apoptosis in SCs as determined by antibody-neutralization studies. These findings demonstrate that MSCs can modulate the function of activated SCs via paracrine mechanisms provide a plausible explanation for the protective role  of MSCs in liver inflammation and fibrosis which may also be relevant to other models of tissue fibrosis.,10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.05.150
0,Cellular function relies on a balance between protein synthesis and breakdown. Macromolecular breakdown through autophagy is broadly required for cellular and tissue development function and recovery from stress. While Caenorhabditis elegans is frequently used to explore cellular responses to development and stress the most common assays for autophagy in this system lack tissue-level resolution. Different tissues within an organism have unique functional characteristics and likely vary in their reliance on autophagy under different conditions. To generate a tissue-specific map of autophagy in C. elegans we used  a dual fluorescent protein (dFP) tag that releases monomeric fluorescent protein  (mFP) upon arrival at the lysosome. Tissue-specific expression of dFP::LGG-1 revealed autophagic flux in all tissues but mFP accumulation was most dramatic in the intestine. We also observed variable responses to stress: starvation increased autophagic mFP release in all tissues whereas anoxia primarily increased intestinal autophagic flux. We observed autophagic flux with tagged LGG-1 LGG-2 and two autophagic cargo reporters: a soluble cytoplasmic protein  and mitochondrial TOMM-7. Finally an increase in mFP in older worms was consistent with an age-dependent shift in proteostasis. These novel measures of autophagic flux in C. elegans reveal heterogeneity in autophagic response across  tissues during stress and aging.,10.18632/aging.100765

0,Chronic stress induces altered energy metabolism and plays important roles in the etiology of depression in which the glucocorticoid negative feedback is disrupted due to imbalanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) functions. The mechanism underlying the dysregulation of GR by chronic stress remains elusive. In this study we investigated the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) the key enzyme regulating cellular energy metabolism and related signaling pathways in chronic stress-induced GR dysregulation. In cultured rat cortical astrocytes glucocorticoid treatment decreased the level which was accompanied by the decreased expression of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and reduced phosphorylation of AMPK. Glucocorticoid-induced effects were attenuated by glucocorticoid-inducible  kinase 1 (SGK1) inhibitor GSK650394 which also inhibited glucocorticoid induced  phosphorylation of Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a). Furthermore glucocorticoid-induced down-regulation of GR was mimicked by the inhibition of AMPK and abolished by the AMPK activators or the histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) inhibitors. In line with the role of AMPK in GR expression AMPK activator metformin reversed glucocorticoid-induced reduction of AMPK phosphorylation and GR expression as well as behavioral alteration of rats. Taken together these results suggest that chronic stress activates SGK1 and suppresses the expression of LKB1 via inhibitory phosphorylation of FOXO3a. Downregulated LKB1 contributes to reduced activation of AMPK leading to the dephosphorylation of HDAC5 and the suppression of transcription of GR.,10.1371/journal.pone.0159513

0,The application of sodium cyanide (NaCN) to the carotid body receptors (CBR) (CBR stimulation) induces rapid blood hyperglycemia and an increase in brain glucose retention. The commissural nucleus tractus solitarius (cNTS) is an essential relay nucleus in this hyperglycemic reflex; it receives glutamatergic afferents (that also release brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF) from the nodose-petrosal ganglia that relays CBR information. Previous work showed that AMPA in NTS blocks hyperglycemia and brain glucose retention after CBR stimulation. In contrast BDNF which attenuates glutamatergic AMPA currents in NTS enhances these glycemic responses. Here we investigated the combined effects of BDNF and AMPA (and their antagonists) in NTS on the glycemic responses to CBR  stimulation. Microinjections of BDNF plus AMPA into the cNTS before CBR stimulation in anesthetized rats induced blood hyperglycemia and an increase in  brain arteriovenous (a-v) of blood glucose concentration difference which we infer is due to increased brain glucose retention. By contrast the microinjection of the TrkB antagonist K252a plus AMPA abolished the glycemic responses to CBR stimulation similar to what is observed after AMPA pretreatments. In BDNF plus AMPA microinjections preceding CBR stimulation the number of c-fos immunoreactive cNTS neurons increased. In contrast in the rats microinjected with K252a plus AMPA in NTS before CBR stimulation c-fos expression in cNTS decreased. The expression of AMPA receptors GluR2/3 did not change in any of the studied groups. These results indicate that BDNF in cNTS plays a key role in the modulation of the hyperglycemic reflex initiated by CBR stimulation.,10.1016/j.autneu.2017.02.001
0,Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However epithelial cell division  must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that  later die. However it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is  activated as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell  density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide Piezo1 localizes to  the plasma membrane and cytoplasm whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.,10.1038/nature21407
0,The representation of high-frequency sensory information is a crucial problem faced by the nervous system. Rodent facial vibrissae constitute a high-resolution sensory system capable of discriminating and detecting subtle changes in tactual input. During active sensing the mechanical properties of vibrissae may play a key role in filtering sensory information and translating it into neural activity. Previous studies have shown that rat vibrissae resonate conferring frequency specificity to trigeminal ganglion (NV) and primary somatosensory cortex (SI) neurons during suprathreshold sensory stimulation. In addition to frequency specificity a further potential impact of vibrissa resonance is enhancement of sensitivity to near-threshold stimuli through signal amplification. To examine the effect of resonance on peri-threshold inputs (<or=80 microm at the vibrissa tip) we recorded NV and SI neurons during stimulation at multiple amplitudes and frequencies and generated minimal amplitude tuning curves. Several novel findings emerged from this study. First vibrissa resonance significantly lowered the threshold for evoked neural activity in many cases by an order of magnitude compared to stimuli presented at off-resonance frequencies. When stimulated at the fundamental resonance frequency motions as small as 8 microm at the vibrissa tip corresponding to angular deflections of less than 0.2 degrees drove neural firing in the periphery and cortex. Second a closer match between vibrissal and neural frequency tuning was found for lower amplitude motions. Third simultaneous paired recordings demonstrated that the minimal amplitude of resonant vibrissa stimulation required to evoke responses in SI increased significantly for recordings outside the primary vibrissa barrel column providing additional evidence for somatotopically localized frequency columns. These data demonstrate  that resonant amplification can increase the sensitivity of the vibrissa sensory  system to an ecologically relevant range of low-amplitude high-frequency stimuli.,10.1016/j.brainres.2008.06.054
0,This paper reports on a study that investigated the aquatic toxicity of new non-ionic surfactants derived from renewable raw materials polyoxyethylene glycerol ester (PGE) and their binary mixtures with anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Toxicity of pure PGEs was determined using representative organisms  from different trophic levels: luminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) microalgae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and freshwater crustaceans (Daphnia magna). Relationships between toxicity and the structural parameters such as unit of ethylene oxide (EO) and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) were evaluated. Critical micellar concentration (CMC) in the conditions of the toxicity test was  also determined. It was found that the toxicity of the aqueous solutions of PGE decreased when the number of EO units in the molecule HLB and CMC increased. PGEs showed lower CMC in marine medium and the toxicity to V. ficheri is lower when the CMC was higher. Given their non-polar nature narcosis was expected to be the primary mode of toxic action of PGEs. For the mixture of surfactants we observed that the mixtures with PGE that had the higher numbers of EO units were  more toxic than the aqueous solutions of pure surfactants. Moreover we found that concentration addition was the type of action more likely to occur for mixtures of PGE with lower numbers of EO units with non-ionic surfactants (alkylpolyglucoside and fatty alcohol ethoxylate) whereas for the mixture of PGE with lower EO units and anionic surfactant (ether carboxylic derivative) the most common response type was response addition. In case of mixtures involving amphoteric surfactants and PGEs with the higher numbers of EO units no clear pattern with regard to the mixture toxicity response type could be observed.,10.1007/s11356-017-8662-9
0,Honeybees contradict the notion that insect behaviour tends to be relatively inflexible and stereotypical. Indeed they live in colonies and exhibit complex social navigational and communication behaviours as well as a relatively rich cognitive repertoire. Because these relatively complex behaviours are controlled  by a brain consisting of only 1 million or so neurons honeybees offer an opportunity to study the relationship between behaviour and cognition in neural networks that are limited in size and complexity. Most recently the honeybee has been used to model learning and memory formation highlighting its utility for neuroscience research in particular for understanding the basis of cognition.,10.1038/nrn3357
0,We tested the sensory impact of repeated synchronization of fast-spiking interneurons (FS) an activity pattern thought to underlie neocortical gamma oscillations. We optogenetically drove 'FS-gamma' while mice detected naturalistic vibrissal stimuli and found enhanced detection of less salient stimuli and impaired detection of more salient ones. Prior studies have predicted that the benefit of FS-gamma is generated when sensory neocortical excitation arrives in a specific temporal window 20-25 ms after FS synchronization. To systematically test this prediction we aligned periodic tactile and optogenetic  stimulation. We found that the detection of less salient stimuli was improved only when peripheral drive led to the arrival of excitation 20-25 ms after synchronization and that other temporal alignments either had no effects or impaired detection. These results provide causal evidence that FS-gamma can enhance processing of less salient stimuli those that benefit from the allocation of attention.,10.1038/nn.3797
0,Cognition requires the dynamic modulation of effective connectivity i.e. the modulation of the postsynaptic neuronal response to a given input. If postsynaptic neurons are rhythmically active this might entail rhythmic gain modulation such that inputs synchronized to phases of high gain benefit from enhanced effective connectivity. We show that visually induced gamma-band activity in awake macaque area V4 rhythmically modulates responses to unpredictable stimulus events. This modulation exceeded a simple additive superposition of a constant response onto ongoing gamma-rhythmic firing demonstrating the modulation of multiplicative gain. Gamma phases leading to strongest neuronal responses also led to shortest behavioral reaction times suggesting functional relevance of the effect. Furthermore we find that constant optogenetic stimulation of anesthetized cat area 21a produces gamma-band activity entailing a similar gain modulation. As the gamma rhythm in area 21a did not spread backward to area 17 this suggests that postsynaptic gamma is sufficient for gain modulation.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.09.003

0,Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons have frequently been regarded as a homogeneous  cell population in biophysical pharmacological and modeling studies. We found robust differences between pyramidal neurons residing in the deep and superficial CA1 sublayers in rats. Compared with their superficial peers deep pyramidal cells fired at higher rates burst more frequently were more likely to have place fields and were more strongly modulated by slow oscillations of sleep. Both deep and superficial pyramidal cells fired preferentially at the trough of theta  oscillations during maze exploration whereas deep pyramidal cells shifted their  preferred phase of firing to the peak of theta during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Furthermore although the majority of REM theta phase-shifting cells fired at the ascending phase of gamma oscillations during waking nonshifting cells preferred the trough. Thus CA1 pyramidal cells in adjacent sublayers can address their targets jointly or differentially depending on brain states.,10.1038/nn.2894

0,A major hurdle in brain-machine interfaces (BMI) is the lack of an implantable neural interface system that remains viable for a substantial fraction of the user's lifetime. Recently sub-mm implantable wireless electromagnetic (EM) neural interfaces have been demonstrated in an effort to extend system longevity. However EM systems do not scale down in size well due to the severe inefficiency of coupling radio-waves at those scales within tissue. This paper explores fundamental system design trade-offs as well as size power and bandwidth scaling limits of neural recording systems built from low-power electronics coupled with ultrasonic power delivery and backscatter communication. Such systems will require two fundamental technology innovations: (1) 10-100 μm scale free-floating independent sensor nodes or neural dust that detect and report local extracellular electrophysiological data via ultrasonic backscattering and (2) a sub-cranial ultrasonic interrogator that establishes power and communication links with the neural dust. We provide experimental verification that the predicted scaling effects follow theory; (127 μm)(3) neural dust motes immersed in water 3 cm from the interrogator couple with 0.002064% power transfer efficiency and 0.04246 ppm backscatter resulting in a maximum received power of  ∼0.5 μW with ∼1 nW of change in backscatter power with neural activity. The high  efficiency of ultrasonic transmission can enable the scaling of the sensing nodes down to 10s of micrometer. We conclude with a brief discussion of the application of neural dust for both central and peripheral nervous system recordings and perspectives on future research directions.,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.07.025

0,Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs) an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal  administration of cannabidiol (CBD) a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally  similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the α3 GlyRs. In contrast the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified α3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the α3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the α3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These  cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment  of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.,10.1084/jem.20120242

0,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that exhibits motor and non-motor symptoms as well as pathological hallmarks including dopaminergic (DA) neuron death and formation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) Lewy bodies.  Cyclin-G-associated kinase (GAK) a PD susceptibility gene identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase involved in clathrin uncoating though its PD-related function remains elusive. Here we implicate the Drosophila GAK homolog auxilin (aux) in a broad spectrum of parkinsonian-like symptoms. Downregulating aux expression leads to progressive loss of climbing ability decreased lifespan and age-dependent DA neuron death similar to α-Syn overexpression. Reduced aux expression further enhances and accelerates α-Syn-mediated DA neuron loss. Flies with reduced aux expression are  more sensitive to the toxin paraquat suggesting that genetic and environmental factors intertwine. Taken together these findings decipher a pivotal role for GAK/aux and suggest mechanisms underlying PD.,10.1016/j.celrep.2017.01.005
0,Conventional definitions of drug addiction are focused on characterizing the neurophysiological and behavioral responses of mammals. Although mammalian models have been invaluable in studying specific and complex aspects of addiction invertebrate systems have proven advantageous in investigating how drugs of abuse corrupt the most basic motivational and neurochemical systems. It has recently been shown that invertebrates and mammals have remarkable similarities in their behavioral and neurochemical responses to drugs of abuse. However until now only mammals have demonstrated drug seeking and self-administration without the concurrent presence of a natural reward e.g. sucrose. Using a sucrose-fading paradigm followed by a two-dish choice test we establish ants as an invertebrate model of opioid addiction. The ant species Camponotus floridanus actively seeks and self-administers morphine even in the absence of caloric value or additional natural reward. Using HPLC equipped with electrochemical detection the neurochemicals serotonin octopamine and dopamine were identified and subsequently quantified establishing the concurrent neurochemical response to the opioid morphine within the invertebrate brain. With this study we demonstrate dopamine to be governing opioid addiction in the brains of ants. Thus this study establishes ants as the first non-mammalian model of self-administration that is truly analogous to mammals.,10.1242/jeb.140616
0,Neuropeptides are essential for the regulation of appetite. Here we show that neuropeptides could regulate feeding in mutants that lack neurotransmission from  the motor neurons that stimulate feeding muscles. We identified nlp-24 by an RNAi screen of 115 neuropeptide genes testing whether they affected growth. NLP-24 peptides have a conserved YGGXX sequence similar to mammalian opioid neuropeptides. In addition morphine and naloxone respectively stimulated and inhibited feeding in starved worms but not in worms lacking NPR-17 which encodes a protein with sequence similarity to opioid receptors. Opioid agonists activated heterologously expressed NPR-17 as did at least one NLP-24 peptide. Worms lacking the ASI neurons which express npr-17 did not response to naloxone. Thus we suggest that Caenorhabditis elegans has an endogenous opioid system that acts through NPR-17 and that opioids regulate feeding via ASI neurons. Together these results suggest C. elegans may be the first genetically  tractable invertebrate opioid model.,10.7554/elife.06683
0,There is a need for new quantitative in vitro models of drug uptake and diffusion to help assess drug toxicity/efficacy as well as new more predictive models for drug discovery. We report a three-dimensional (3D) multilayer spheroid model and  a new algorithm to quantitatively study uptake and inward diffusion of fluorescent calcein via gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC). When incubated with calcein-AM a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) spheroids from a variety of cell types accumulated calcein over time. Accumulation decreased in spheroids overexpressing Pgp (HEK-MDR) and was increased in the presence of Pgp inhibitors (verapamil loperamide cyclosporin A). Inward diffusion of calcein was negligible in spheroids that lacked GJIC (OVCAR-3 SK-OV-3) and was reduced in the presence of an inhibitor of GJIC (carbenoxolone). In addition to inhibiting Pgp verapamil and loperamide but not cyclosporin A inhibited inward diffusion of calcein suggesting that they also inhibit GJIC. The dose response curves of verapamil's inhibition of Pgp and GJIC  were similar (IC50: 8 μM). The method is amenable to many different cell types and may serve as a quantitative 3D model that more accurately replicates in vivo  barriers to drug uptake and diffusion.,10.1021/mp500002y
0,Dopamine is associated with a variety of conserved responses across species including locomotion sleep food consumption aggression courtship addiction and several forms of appetitive and aversive memory. Historically dopamine has been most prominently associated with dynamics underlying reward punishment or  salience. Recent emerging evidence from Drosophila supports a role in all of these functions as well as additional roles in the interplay between external sensation and internal states and forgetting of the very memories dopamine helped encode. We discuss how cell-specific resolution and manipulation are elucidating  the rules of dopamine's involvement in encoding valence and memory.,10.1016/j.conb.2016.12.011

0,Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and microRNA processing. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in 90%  of patients with Rett syndrome a severe developmental disorder with autistic phenotypes. Duplications of MECP2-containing genomic segments cause the MECP2 duplication syndrome which shares core symptoms with autism spectrum disorders.  Although Mecp2-null mice recapitulate most developmental and behavioural defects  seen in patients with Rett syndrome it has been difficult to identify autism-like behaviours in the mouse model of MeCP2 overexpression. Here we report that lentivirus-based transgenic cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) expressing human MeCP2 in the brain exhibit autism-like behaviours and show germline transmission of the transgene. Expression of the MECP2 transgene was confirmed by western blotting and immunostaining of brain tissues of transgenic monkeys. Genomic integration sites of the transgenes were characterized by a deep-sequencing-based method. As compared to wild-type monkeys MECP2 transgenic  monkeys exhibited a higher frequency of repetitive circular locomotion and increased stress responses as measured by the threat-related anxiety and defensive test. The transgenic monkeys showed less interaction with wild-type monkeys within the same group and also a reduced interaction time when paired with other transgenic monkeys in social interaction tests. The cognitive functions of the transgenic monkeys were largely normal in the Wisconsin general  test apparatus although some showed signs of stereotypic cognitive behaviours. Notably we succeeded in generating five F1 offspring of MECP2 transgenic monkeys by intracytoplasmic sperm injection with sperm from one F0 transgenic monkey showing germline transmission and Mendelian segregation of several MECP2 transgenes in the F1 progeny. Moreover F1 transgenic monkeys also showed reduced social interactions when tested in pairs as compared to wild-type monkeys of similar age. Together these results indicate the feasibility and reliability of  using genetically engineered non-human primates to study brain disorders.,10.1038/nature16533

0,A series of Fe(III) complexes were recently reported that are stable and active electrocatalysts for reducing protons into hydrogen gas. Herein we report the incorporation of these electrocatalysts into a photocatalytic system for hydrogen production. Hydrogen evolution is observed when these catalysts are paired with fluorescein (chromophore) and triethylamine (sacrificial electron source) in a 1:1 ethanol:water mixture. The photocatalytic system is highly active and stable achieving TONs > 2100 (with respect to catalyst) after 24 h. Catalysis proceeds through a reductive quenching pathway with a quantum yield of over 3%.,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01413

0,We often face the challenge of simultaneously attending to multiple non-contiguous regions of space. There is ongoing debate as to how spatial attention is divided under these situations. Whereas for several years the predominant view was that humans could divide the attentional spotlight several  recent studies argue in favor of a unitary spotlight that rhythmically samples relevant locations. Here this issue was addressed by the use of high-density electrophysiology in concert with the multifocal m-sequence technique to examine  visual evoked responses to multiple simultaneous streams of stimulation. Concurrently we assayed the topographic distribution of alpha-band oscillatory mechanisms a measure of attentional suppression. Participants performed a difficult detection task that required simultaneous attention to two stimuli in contiguous (undivided) or non-contiguous parts of space. In the undivided condition the classic pattern of attentional modulation was observed with increased amplitude of the early visual evoked response and increased alpha amplitude ipsilateral to the attended hemifield. For the divided condition early visual responses to attended stimuli were also enhanced and the observed multifocal topographic distribution of alpha suppression was in line with the divided attention hypothesis. These results support the existence of divided attentional spotlights providing evidence that the corresponding modulation occurs during initial sensory processing time-frames in hierarchically early visual regions and that suppressive mechanisms of visual attention selectively target distracter locations during divided spatial attention.,10.1111/ejn.12523
0,The hippocampus has long been known to be involved in spatial navigational learning in rodents and in memory for events in rodents primates and humans. A  unifying property of both navigation and event memory is a requirement for dealing with temporally sequenced information. Reactivation of temporally sequenced memories for previous behavioural experiences has been reported in sleep in rats. Here we report that sequential replay occurs in the rat hippocampus during awake periods immediately after spatial experience. This replay has a unique form in which recent episodes of spatial experience are replayed in a temporally reversed order. This replay is suggestive of a role in the evaluation of event sequences in the manner of reinforcement learning models. We propose that such replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and  memory.,10.1038/nature04587

0,A fundamental step in visual pattern recognition is the establishment of relations between spatially separate features. Recently we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40-60 Hz (refs 1 2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field. In support of this hypothesis we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses. The synchronization has on average no  phase difference depends on the spatial separation and the orientation preference of the cells and is influenced by global stimulus properties.,10.1038/338334a0
0,Neocortical activity can evoke sensory percepts but the cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We trained mice to detect single brief whisker stimuli  and report perceived stimuli by licking to obtain a reward. Pharmacological inactivation and optogenetic stimulation demonstrated a causal role for the primary somatosensory barrel cortex. Whole-cell recordings from barrel cortex neurons revealed membrane potential correlates of sensory perception. Sensory responses depended strongly on prestimulus cortical state but both slow-wave and desynchronized cortical states were compatible with task performance. Whisker deflection evoked an early (<50 ms) reliable sensory response that was encoded through cell-specific reversal potentials. A secondary late (50-400 ms) depolarization was enhanced on hit trials compared to misses. Optogenetic inactivation revealed a causal role for late excitation. Our data reveal dynamic  processing in the sensory cortex during task performance with an early sensory response reliably encoding the stimulus and later secondary activity contributing to driving the subjective percept.,10.1038/nn.3532
0,The cortex contains multiple cell types but studies of attention have not distinguished between them limiting understanding of the local circuits that transform attentional feedback into improved visual processing. Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished from pyramidal neurons based on their briefer action potential durations. We recorded  neurons in area V4 as monkeys performed an attention-demanding task. We find that the distribution of action potential durations is strongly bimodal. Neurons with  narrow action potentials have higher firing rates and larger attention-dependent  increases in absolute firing rate than neurons with broad action potentials. The  percentage increase in response is similar across the two classes. We also find evidence that attention increases the reliability of the neuronal response. This  modulation is more than two-fold stronger among putative interneurons. These findings lead to the surprising conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas.,10.1016/j.neuron.2007.06.018
0,Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a region of prefrontal cortex implicated in the motivational control of behavior and in related abnormalities seen in psychosis and depression. It has been hypothesized that a critical mechanism in these disorders is the dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons that normally regulate prefrontal information processing. Here we studied a subclass of interneurons isolated in rat OFC using extracellular waveform and spike train analysis. During performance of a goal-directed behavioral task the firing of this class of putative fast-spiking (FS) interneurons showed robust temporal correlations indicative of a functionally coherent network. FS cell activity also co-varied with behavioral response latency a key indicator of motivational state. Systemic administration of ketamine a drug that can mimic psychosis preferentially inhibited this cell class. Together these results support the idea that OFC-FS interneurons form a critical link in the regulation of motivation by prefrontal circuits during normal and abnormal brain and behavioral states.,10.3389/neuro.06.013.2009
0,We rely on movement to explore the environment for example by palpating an object. In somatosensory cortex activity related to movement of digits or whiskers is suppressed which could facilitate detection of touch. Movement-related suppression is generally assumed to involve corollary discharges. Here we uncovered a thalamocortical mechanism in which cortical fast-spiking interneurons driven by sensory input suppress movement-related activity in layer 4 (L4) excitatory neurons. In mice locating objects with their  whiskers neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) fired in response to touch and whisker movement. Cortical L4 fast-spiking interneurons inherited these responses from VPM. In contrast L4 excitatory neurons responded mainly to touch. Optogenetic experiments revealed that fast-spiking interneurons reduced movement-related spiking in excitatory neurons enhancing selectivity for touch-related information during active tactile sensation. These observations suggest a fundamental computation performed by the thalamocortical circuit to accentuate salient tactile information.,10.1038/nn.4412
0,Serotonin (5-HT) regulates attention by neurobiological mechanisms that are not well understood. Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex play an important role in attention and express 5-HT receptors but the serotonergic modulation of this layer and its excitatory output is not known. Here we performed whole-cell recordings and pharmacological manipulations in acute brain  slices from wild-type and transgenic mice expressing either eGFP or eGFP-channelrhodopsin in prefrontal L6 pyramidal neurons. Excitatory circuits between L6 pyramidal neurons and L5 GABAergic interneurons including a population of interneurons essential for task attention were investigated using  optogenetic techniques. Our experiments show that prefrontal L6 pyramidal neurons are subject to strong serotonergic inhibition and demonstrate direct 5-HT-sensitive connections between prefrontal L6 pyramidal neurons and two classes of L5 interneurons. This work helps to build a neurobiological framework  to appreciate serotonergic disruption of task attention and yields insight into the disruptions of attention observed in psychiatric disorders with altered 5-HT  receptors and signaling.,10.1523/eneuro.0269-16.2016

0,This study included 168 and 85 mother-infant dyads from Asian and United States of America cohorts to examine whether a genomic profile risk score for major depressive disorder (GPRSMDD) moderates the association between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms (or socio-economic status SES) and fetal neurodevelopment and to identify candidate biological processes underlying such  association. Both cohorts showed a significant interaction between antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and infant GPRSMDD on the right amygdala volume. The Asian cohort also showed such interaction on the right hippocampal volume and shape thickness of the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Likewise a significant interaction between SES and infant GPRSMDD was on the right amygdala and hippocampal volumes and shapes. After controlling for each other the interaction effect of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms and GPRSMDD was mainly shown on the right amygdala while the interaction effect of SES and GPRSMDD was mainly shown on the right hippocampus. Bioinformatic analyses suggested neurotransmitter/neurotrophic signaling SNAp REceptor complex and glutamate receptor activity as common biological processes underlying the influence of antenatal maternal depressive symptoms on fetal cortico-limbic development. These findings suggest gene-environment interdependence in the fetal development of brain regions implicated in cognitive-emotional function. Candidate biological mechanisms involve a range of brain region-specific signaling pathways that converge on common processes of synaptic development.,10.1093/cercor/bhx065

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to model the movement and idle-related EEG data. The GMM built along with appropriate classification and post processing methods are used to detect movement onsets using self-paced EEG signals recorded from five subjects achieving True-False rate difference between 63 and 98%. The results show significant performance enhancement using the proposed unsupervised method both in the sample-by-sample classification accuracy and the event-by-event performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods.

0,OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could potentially be used to interact with pathological brain signals to intervene and ameliorate their effects in disease states. Here we provide proof-of-principle of this approach by using a BCI to interpret pathological brain activity in patients with advanced Parkinson  disease (PD) and to use this feedback to control when therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is delivered. Our goal was to demonstrate that by personalizing and optimizing stimulation in real time we could improve on both the efficacy and efficiency of conventional continuous DBS. METHODS: We tested BCI-controlled adaptive DBS (aDBS) of the subthalamic nucleus  in 8 PD patients. Feedback was provided by processing of the local field potentials recorded directly from the stimulation electrodes. The results were compared to no stimulation conventional continuous stimulation (cDBS) and random intermittent stimulation. Both unblinded and blinded clinical assessments  of motor effect were performed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Motor scores improved by 66% (unblinded) and 50% (blinded) during aDBS  which were 29% (p = 0.03) and 27% (p = 0.005) better than cDBS respectively. These improvements were achieved with a 56% reduction in stimulation time compared to cDBS and a corresponding reduction in energy requirements (p < 0.001). aDBS was also more effective than no stimulation and random intermittent  stimulation. INTERPRETATION: BCI-controlled DBS is tractable and can be more efficient and efficacious than conventional continuous neuromodulation for PD.,10.1002/ana.23951
0,OBJECTIVE: We present a proof of concept for a novel method of predicting the onset of pathological tremor using non-invasively measured surface electromyogram (sEMG) and acceleration from tremor-affected extremities of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). APPROACH: The tremor prediction algorithm uses a set of spectral (Fourier and wavelet) and nonlinear time series (entropy and recurrence rate) parameters extracted from the non-invasively recorded sEMG and acceleration signals. MAIN RESULTS: The resulting algorithm is shown to successfully predict tremor onset for all 91 trials recorded in 4 PD patients and for all 91 trials recorded  in 4 ET patients. The predictor achieves a 100% sensitivity for all trials considered along with an overall accuracy of 85.7% for all ET trials and 80.2% for all PD trials. By using a Pearson's chi-square test the prediction results are shown to significantly differ from a random prediction outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: The tremor prediction algorithm can be potentially used for designing the next generation of non-invasive closed-loop predictive ON-OFF controllers for deep brain stimulation (DBS) used for suppressing pathological tremor in such patients. Such a system is based on alternating ON and OFF DBS periods an incoming tremor being predicted during the time intervals when DBS is OFF so as to turn DBS back ON. The prediction should be a few seconds before tremor re-appears so that the patient is tremor-free for the entire DBS ON-OFF cycle and the tremor-free DBS OFF interval should be maximized in order to minimize the current injected in the brain and battery usage.,10.1088/1741-2560/10/3/036019

Thalamic deep brain stimulation a surgical therapy for otherwise intractable cases has been shown to improve tremor but its impact on cerebellar-like gait difficulties remains to be elucidated. Eleven  patients affected by essential tremor (five females; age 69.8 ± 3.9 years; disease duration 24.4 ± 11.2 years; follow-up after surgery 24.7 ± 20.3 months) were evaluated during the following conditions: stimulation off stimulation on and supra-therapeutic stimulation. Ten age-matched healthy controls served as the comparison group. Locomotion by patients and controls was assessed with (i) overground gait and tandem gait; (ii) balance-assisted treadmill tandem gait and  (iii) unassisted treadmill gait. The two treadmill paradigms were kinematically analysed using a 3D opto-electronic motion analysis system. Established clinical  and kinesiological measures of ataxia were computed. During stimulation off the  patients exhibited ataxia in all assessment paradigms which improved during stimulation on and worsened again during supra-therapeutic stimulation. During over ground tandem gait patients had more missteps and slower gait velocities during stimulation off and supra-therapeutic stimulation than during stimulation  on. During balance-assisted tandem gait stimulation on reduced the temporospatial variability in foot trajectories to nearly normal values while highly variable (ataxic) foot trajectories were observed during stimulation off and supra-therapeutic stimulation. During unassisted treadmill gait stimulation  on improved gait stability compared with stimulation off and supra-therapeutic stimulation as demonstrated by increased gait velocity and ankle rotation. These improvements in ataxia were not a function of reduced tremor in the lower limbs or torso. In conclusion we demonstrate the impact of thalamic stimulation on gait ataxia in patients with essential tremor with improvement by stimulation on  and deterioration by supra-therapeutic stimulation despite continued control of  tremor. Thus cerebellar dysfunction in these patients can be differentially modulated with optimal versus supra-therapeutic stimulation. The cerebellar movement disorder of essential tremor is due to a typical cerebellar deficit not to trembling extremities. We hypothesize that deep brain stimulation affects two  major regulating circuits: the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop for tremor reduction and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway for ataxia reduction (stimulation on)  and ataxia induction (supra-therapeutic stimulation).,10.1093/brain/awq267
0,Visual cortical areas subserve cognitive functions by interacting in both feedforward and feedback directions. While feedforward influences convey sensory  signals feedback influences modulate feedforward signaling according to the current behavioral context. We investigated whether these interareal influences are subserved differentially by rhythmic synchronization. We correlated frequency-specific directed influences among 28 pairs of visual areas with anatomical metrics of the feedforward or feedback character of the respective interareal projections. This revealed that in the primate visual system feedforward influences are carried by theta-band (∼ 4 Hz) and gamma-band (∼ 60-80 Hz) synchronization and feedback influences by beta-band (∼ 14-18 Hz) synchronization. The functional directed influences constrain a functional hierarchy similar to the anatomical hierarchy but exhibiting task-dependent dynamic changes in particular with regard to the hierarchical positions of frontal areas. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signaling use distinct frequency channels suggesting that they subserve differential communication requirements.,10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.018
0,Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that  motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.,10.1038/nature11129
0,The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central to flexible and organized action. Recent theoretical and empirical results suggest that the rostro-caudal axis of the frontal lobes may reflect a hierarchical organization of control. Here we test whether the rostro-caudal axis of the PFC is organized hierarchically based on the level of abstraction at which multiple representations compete to guide selection of action. Four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments parametrically manipulated the set of task-relevant (a) responses (b) features (c) dimensions and (d) overlapping cue-to-dimension mappings. A systematic posterior to anterior gradient was evident within the PFC depending on the manipulated level of representation. Furthermore across four fMRI experiments activation in PFC subregions was consistent with the sub- and superordinate relationships that define an abstract representational hierarchy. In addition to providing further support for a representational hierarchy account of the rostro-caudal gradient in the PFC these data provide important empirical  constraints on current theorizing about control hierarchies and the PFC.,10.1162/jocn.2007.19.12.2082

0,The ability to extract deep structures from auditory sequences is a fundamental prerequisite of language acquisition. Using fMRI in untrained macaques and humans we investigated the brain areas involved in representing two abstract properties of a series of tones: total number of items and tone-repetition pattern. Both species represented the number of tones in intraparietal and dorsal premotor areas and the tone-repetition pattern in ventral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. However we observed a joint sensitivity to both parameters only in humans within bilateral inferior frontal and superior temporal regions. In the left hemisphere those sites coincided with areas involved in language processing. Thus while some abstract properties of auditory sequences are available to non-human primates a recently evolved circuit may endow humans with a unique ability for representing linguistic and non-linguistic sequences in a unified manner.,10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.035
0,Functional brain organization of macaque monkeys and humans was directly compared by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects of both species performed a modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test that required behavioral flexibility in the  form of cognitive set shifting. Equivalent visual stimuli and task sequence were  used for the two species. We found transient activation related to cognitive set  shifting in focal regions of prefrontal cortex in both monkeys and humans. These  functional homologs were located in cytoarchitectonically equivalent regions in the posterior part of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. This comparative imaging provides insights into the evolution of cognition in primates.,10.1126/science.1067653
0,Iron oxide contrast agents have been employed extensively in anesthetized rodents to enhance fMRI sensitivity and to study the physiology of cerebral blood volume  (CBV) in relation to blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal following neuronal activation. This study quantified the advantages of exogenous agent for  repeated neuroimaging in awake nonhuman primates using a clinical 3 Tesla scanner. A monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle (MION) solution was injected at iron doses of 8 to 10 mg/kg in two macaque monkeys. Adverse behavioral effects due to contrast agent were not observed in either monkey using cumulative doses in excess of 60 mg/kg. Relative to BOLD imaging at 3 Tesla MION increased functional sensitivity by an average factor of 3 across the brain for a stimulus  of long duration. Rapid stimulus presentation attenuated MION signal changes more than BOLD signal changes due to the slower time constant of the blood volume response relative to BOLD signal. Overall the contrast agent produced a dramatic improvement in functional brain imaging results in the awake behaving primate at this field strength.

0,Several factors affecting the power of Doppler scattered signal and consequently microembolus size estimation may be eliminated when assessing the  microembolus size via multiple measurements. A new microembolus size estimator is proposed based on the ratio of microembolus scattering cross-section in two directions and for two emission frequencies. Theoretical considerations indicate  that the estimation of size of microembolic elements should be independent of the spatial distribution of the wave intensity tissue attenuation and hardware factors. The simulation results indicate that this estimation only slightly depends on the material of the microembolus and acoustic properties of blood. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of median size estimation increases with microembolus size. The measurement error is less than 27% for microemboli with median diameter larger than 360 μm. The method is constrained to the estimation of microembolus size in the vessels of extremities.,10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.12.001
0,The transcranial Doppler (TCD) radio-frequency (RF) signal can provide additional information on events recorded during ultrasonic monitoring. Embolic signals appear as uniform and predictable shapes within the RF signal enabling pattern recognition and image processing techniques to be used for their automated detection. This paper uses principal component analysis (PCA) to characterise the typical variation in embolic signal shape within the RF signal using training sets of in vitro and in vivo data. PCA techniques are then utilised to discriminate between previously unseen embolic and artifact signals. Although the results of this study show that the algorithms described in this paper do not yet have the accuracy required for their use in a clinical setting it does demonstrate that this novel technique has the potential to be developed further.,10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.06.019

0,Neuroprosthesis research aims to enable communication between the brain and external assistive devices while restoring lost functionality such as occurs from stroke spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative diseases. In future closed-loop sensorimotor prostheses one approach is to use neuromodulation as direct stimulus to the brain to compensate for a lost sensory function and help the brain to integrate relevant information for commanding external devices via e.g. movement intention. Current neuromodulation techniques rely mainly of electrical  stimulation. Here we focus specifically on the question of eliciting a biomimetically relevant sense of touch by direct stimulus of the somatosensory cortex by introducing optogenetic techniques as an alternative to electrical stimulation. We demonstrate that light activated opsins can be introduced to target neurons in the somatosensory cortex of non-human primates and be optically activated to create a reliably detected sensation which the animal learns to interpret as a tactile sensation localized within the hand. The accomplishment highlighted here shows how optical stimulation of a relatively small group of mostly excitatory somatosensory neurons in the nonhuman primate brain is sufficient for eliciting a useful sensation from data acquired by simultaneous electrophysiology and from behavioral metrics. In this first report to date on optically neuromodulated behavior in the somatosensory cortex of nonhuman primates we do not yet dissect the details of the sensation the animals exerience or contrast it to those evoked by electrical stimulation issues of considerable  future interest.,10.1371/journal.pone.0114529
0,Brain recordings in large animal models and humans typically rely on a tethered connection which has restricted the spectrum of accessible experimental and clinical applications. To overcome this limitation we have engineered a compact lightweight high data rate wireless neurosensor capable of recording the full spectrum of electrophysiological signals from the cortex of mobile subjects. The  wireless communication system exploits a spatially distributed network of synchronized receivers that is scalable to hundreds of channels and vast environments. To demonstrate the versatility of our wireless neurosensor we monitored cortical neuron populations in freely behaving nonhuman primates during natural locomotion and sleep-wake transitions in ecologically equivalent settings. The interface is electrically safe and compatible with the majority of  existing neural probes which may support previously inaccessible experimental and clinical research.,10.1016/j.neuron.2014.11.010
0,Transient gamma-band (40-80 Hz) spatiotemporal patterns are hypothesized to play  important roles in cortical function. Here we report the direct observation of gamma oscillations as spatiotemporal waves induced by targeted optogenetic stimulation recorded by intracortical multichannel extracellular techniques in macaque monkeys during their awake resting states. Microelectrode arrays integrating an optical fiber at their center were chronically implanted in primary motor (M1) and ventral premotor (PMv) cortices of two subjects. Targeted  brain tissue was transduced with the red-shifted opsin C1V1(T/T). Constant (1-s square pulses) and ramp stimulation induced narrowband gamma oscillations during  awake resting states. Recordings across 95 microelectrodes (4 × 4-mm array) enabled us to track the transient gamma spatiotemporal patterns manifested e.g. as concentric expanding and spiral waves. Gamma oscillations were induced well beyond the light stimulation volume via network interactions at distal electrode sites depending on optical power. Despite stimulation-related modulation in spiking rates neuronal spiking remained highly asynchronous during induced gamma oscillations. In one subject we examined stimulation effects during preparation and execution of a motor task and observed that movement execution largely attenuated optically induced gamma oscillations. Our findings demonstrate that beyond previously reported induced gamma activity under periodic drive a prolonged constant stimulus above a certain threshold may carry primate motor cortex network dynamics into gamma oscillations likely via a Hopf bifurcation. More broadly the experimental capability in combining microelectrode array recordings and optogenetic stimulation provides an important approach for probing spatiotemporal dynamics in primate cortical networks during various physiological and behavioral conditions.,10.1152/jn.00792.2014
0,Transitions into primary generalized epileptic seizures occur abruptly and synchronously across the brain. Their potential triggers remain unknown. We used  optogenetics to causally test the hypothesis that rhythmic population bursting of excitatory neurons in a local neocortical region can rapidly trigger absence seizures. Most previous studies have been purely correlational and it remains unclear whether epileptiform events induced by rhythmic stimulation (e.g. sensory/electrical) mimic actual spontaneous seizures especially regarding their spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study we used a novel combination of intracortical optogenetic stimulation and microelectrode array recordings in freely moving WAG/Rij rats a model of absence epilepsy with a cortical focus in  the somatosensory cortex (SI). We report three main findings: 1) Brief rhythmic bursting evoked by optical stimulation of neocortical excitatory neurons at frequencies around 10 Hz induced seizures consisting of self-sustained spike-wave discharges (SWDs) for about 10% of stimulation trials. The probability of inducing seizures was frequency-dependent reaching a maximum at 10 Hz. 2) Local field potential power before stimulation and response amplitudes during stimulation both predicted seizure induction demonstrating a modulatory effect of brain states and neural excitation levels. 3) Evoked responses during stimulation propagated as cortical waves likely reaching the cortical focus which in turn generated self-sustained SWDs after stimulation was terminated. Importantly SWDs during induced and spontaneous seizures propagated with the same spatiotemporal dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that local rhythmic bursting of excitatory neurons in neocortex at particular frequencies under susceptible ongoing brain states is sufficient to trigger primary generalized seizures with stereotypical spatiotemporal dynamics.,10.1152/jn.01040.2014

0,Optogenetics the selective excitation or inhibition of neural circuits by light has become a transformative approach for dissecting functional brain microcircuits particularly in in vivo rodent models owing to the expanding libraries of opsins and promoters. Yet there is a lack of versatile devices that  can deliver spatiotemporally patterned light while performing simultaneous sensing to map the dynamics of perturbed neural populations at the network level. We have created optoelectronic actuator and sensor microarrays that can be used as monolithic intracortical implants fabricated from an optically transparent electrically highly conducting semiconductor ZnO crystal. The devices can perform simultaneous light delivery and electrical readout in precise spatial registry across the microprobe array. We applied the device technology in transgenic mice  to study light-perturbed cortical microcircuit dynamics and their effects on behavior. The functionality of this device can be further expanded to optical imaging and patterned electrical microstimulation.,10.1038/nmeth.3620
0,Luminopsins are fusion proteins of luciferase and opsin that allow interrogation  of neuronal circuits at different temporal and spatial resolutions by choosing either extrinsic physical or intrinsic biological light for its activation. Building on previous development of fusions of wild-type Gaussia luciferase with  channelrhodopsin here we expanded the utility of luminopsins by fusing bright Gaussia luciferase variants with either channelrhodopsin to excite neurons (luminescent opsin LMO) or a proton pump to inhibit neurons (inhibitory LMO iLMO). These improved LMOs could reliably activate or silence neurons in vitro and in vivo. Expression of the improved LMO in hippocampal circuits not only enabled mapping of synaptic activation of CA1 neurons with fine spatiotemporal resolution but also could drive rhythmic circuit excitation over a large spatiotemporal scale. Furthermore virus-mediated expression of either LMO or iLMO in the substantia nigra in vivo produced not only the expected bidirectional control of single unit activity but also opposing effects on circling behavior in response to systemic injection of a luciferase substrate. Thus although preserving the ability to be activated by external light sources LMOs expand the use of optogenetics by making the same opsins accessible to noninvasive chemogenetic control thereby allowing the same probe to manipulate neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales.,10.1073/pnas.1510899113

0,Response modulation by prior sensory stimulation is a common property of cortical neurons. The degree to which effects are specific to the adapting stimulus provides insights into properties of the underlying circuitry. Here we examined  the effects of an adapting whisker deflection's angle on the angular tuning of layer IV barrel neurons and their major input source thalamic barreloid neurons. In both barrel regular-spike units (RSUs) and fast-spike units (FSUs) presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons prior whisker deflections suppressed subsequent test deflections in a largely angularly nonspecific manner that is adaptation in one direction reduced responses for test deflections of all angles. FSUs were poorly tuned for deflection angle and remained so after adaptation. In  adapted RSUs responses to suboptimal directions were suppressed most and angular preferences remained constant; tuning therefore became sharper. Adaptation effects in RSUs and FSUs do not appear to reflect corresponding changes in thalamic neurons. The angularly nonspecific suppression of barrel neurons is likely mediated by local intrabarrel suppressive interactions such as broadly tuned inhibition and/or short-term synaptic depression of excitatory connections. The dominance of angularly nonspecific suppression suggests that barrel neurons interact largely in an angularly nonspecific manner to reinforce stimulus preferences encoded by their synchronously firing thalamic inputs.,10.1093/cercor/bhk006
0,Full understanding of the functional complexity of the protein interactome requires mapping of biomolecular complexes within the cellular environment over biologically relevant time scales. New approaches to imaging interacting protein  partners in vivo will allow the study of functional proteomics of human biology and disease within the context of living animals. Herein we describe a universal transgenic reporter mouse strain that expresses firefly luciferase (Fluc) under the regulatory control of a concatenated Gal4 promoter (Tg(G4F(+/-))). Using an adenovirus to deliver a fused binding-domain-activator chimera (Gal4BD-VP16) induction of bioluminescence in Tg(G4F(+/-)) tissues of up to 4 orders of magnitude was observed in fibroblasts liver respiratory epithelia muscle and  brain. The Tg(G4F(+/-)) reporter strain allowed noninvasive detection of viral infectivity duration of the infection as well as viral clearance in various tissues in vivo. To demonstrate protein-protein interactions in live mice the well characterized interaction between tumor suppressor p53 (fused to Gal4BD) and large T antigen (TAg) (fused to VP16) was visualized in vivo by using a two-hybrid strategy. Hepatocytes of Tg(G4F(+/-)) mice transfected with p53/TAg demonstrated 48-fold greater induction of Fluc expression in vivo than noninteracting pairs. Furthermore to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring experimental therapy with siRNA in vivo targeted knockdown of p53 resulted in markedly reduced light output whereas use of a control siRNA had no effect on protein interaction-dependent induction of Fluc. Thus this highly inducible Gal4-->Fluc conditional reporter strain should facilitate imaging studies of protein interactions signaling cascades viral dissemination and therapy within the physiological context of the whole animal.,10.1073/pnas.0801075105

0,Because it lacks a lymphatic circulation the brain must clear extracellular proteins by an alternative mechanism. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) functions as  a sink for brain extracellular solutes but it is not clear how solutes from the  brain interstitium move from the parenchyma to the CSF. We demonstrate that a substantial portion of subarachnoid CSF cycles through the brain interstitial space. On the basis of in vivo two-photon imaging of small fluorescent tracers we showed that CSF enters the parenchyma along paravascular spaces that surround  penetrating arteries and that brain interstitial fluid is cleared along paravenous drainage pathways. Animals lacking the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes exhibit slowed CSF influx through this system and a ~70% reduction in interstitial solute clearance suggesting that the bulk fluid flow between these anatomical influx and efflux routes is supported by astrocytic water transport. Fluorescent-tagged amyloid β a peptide thought to be pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease was transported along this route and deletion of the Aqp4 gene suppressed the clearance of soluble amyloid β suggesting that this pathway may remove amyloid β from the central nervous system. Clearance through paravenous flow may also regulate extracellular levels of proteins involved with  neurodegenerative conditions its impairment perhaps contributing to the mis-accumulation of soluble proteins.,10.1126/scitranslmed.3003748
0,Living organisms produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to kill invading pathogens  and for cellular signaling but aberrant generation of this reactive oxygen species is a hallmark of oxidative stress and inflammation in aging injury and  disease. The effects of H(2)O(2) on the overall health of living animals remain elusive in part owing to a dearth of methods for studying this transient small molecule in vivo. Here we report the design synthesis and in vivo applications  of Peroxy Caged Luciferin-1 (PCL-1) a chemoselective bioluminescent probe for the real-time detection of H(2)O(2) within living animals. PCL-1 is a boronic acid-caged firefly luciferin molecule that selectively reacts with H(2)O(2) to release firefly luciferin which triggers a bioluminescent response in the presence of firefly luciferase. The high sensitivity and selectivity of PCL-1 for H(2)O(2) combined with the favorable properties of bioluminescence for in vivo imaging afford a unique technology for real-time detection of basal levels of H(2)O(2) generated in healthy living mice. Moreover we demonstrate the efficacy of PCL-1 for monitoring physiological fluctuations in H(2)O(2) levels by directly imaging elevations in H(2)O(2) within testosterone-stimulated tumor xenografts in vivo. The ability to chemoselectively monitor H(2)O(2) fluxes in real time in living animals offers opportunities to dissect H(2)O(2)'s disparate contributions to health aging and disease.,10.1073/pnas.1012864107
0,Visual attention can improve behavioral performance by allowing observers to focus on the important information in a complex scene. Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead over 80% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the  trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons  and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.,10.1038/nn.2439
0,Predictions about future rewarding events have a powerful influence on behaviour. The phasic spike activity of dopamine-containing neurons and corresponding dopamine transients in the striatum are thought to underlie these predictions encoding positive and negative reward prediction errors. However many behaviours are directed towards distant goals for which transient signals may fail to provide sustained drive. Here we report an extended mode of reward-predictive dopamine signalling in the striatum that emerged as rats moved towards distant goals. These dopamine signals which were detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) gradually increased or--in rare instances--decreased as the animals navigated mazes to reach remote rewards rather than having phasic or steady tonic profiles. These dopamine increases (ramps) scaled flexibly with both the distance and size of the rewards. During learning these dopamine signals showed spatial preferences for goals in different locations and readily changed in magnitude to reflect changing values of the distant rewards. Such prolonged dopamine signalling could provide sustained motivational drive a control mechanism that may be important for normal behaviour and that can be impaired in  a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders.,10.1038/nature12475
0,Dopamine cell firing can encode errors in reward prediction providing a learning signal to guide future behavior. Yet dopamine is also a key modulator of motivation invigorating current behavior. Existing theories propose that fast (phasic) dopamine fluctuations support learning whereas much slower (tonic) dopamine changes are involved in motivation. We examined dopamine release in the  nucleus accumbens across multiple time scales using complementary microdialysis  and voltammetric methods during adaptive decision-making. We found that minute-by-minute dopamine levels covaried with reward rate and motivational vigor. Second-by-second dopamine release encoded an estimate of temporally discounted future reward (a value function). Changing dopamine immediately altered willingness to work and reinforced preceding action choices by encoding temporal-difference reward prediction errors. Our results indicate that dopamine  conveys a single rapidly evolving decision variable the available reward for investment of effort which is employed for both learning and motivational functions.,10.1038/nn.4173
0,Manipulation of neuronal activity through genetically targeted actuator molecules is a powerful approach for studying information flow in the brain. In these approaches the genetically targeted component a receptor or a channel is activated either by a small molecule (chemical genetics) or by light from a physical source (optogenetics). We developed a hybrid technology that allows control of the same neurons by both optogenetic and chemical genetic means. The approach is based on engineered chimeric fusions of a light-generating protein (luciferase) to a light-activated ion channel (channelrhodopsin). Ionic currents  then can be activated by bioluminescence upon activation of luciferase by its substrate coelenterazine (CTZ) as well as by external light. In cell lines expression of the fusion of Gaussia luciferase to Channelrhodopsin-2 yielded photocurrents in response to CTZ. Larger photocurrents were produced by fusing the luciferase to Volvox Channelrhodopsin-1. This version allowed chemical modulation of neuronal activity when expressed in cultured neurons: CTZ treatment shifted neuronal responses to injected currents and sensitized neurons to fire action potentials in response to subthreshold synaptic inputs. These luminescent  channelrhodopsins--or luminopsins--preserve the advantages of light-activated ion channels while extending their capabilities. Our proof-of-principle results suggest that this novel class of tools can be improved and extended in numerous ways.,10.1371/journal.pone.0059759
0,"Attention can be focused volitionally by ""top-down"" signals derived from task demands and automatically by ""bottom-up"" signals from salient stimuli. The frontal and parietal cortices are involved but their neural activity has not been directly compared. Therefore we recorded from them simultaneously in monkeys. Prefrontal neurons reflected the target location first during top-down attention whereas parietal neurons signaled it earlier during bottom-up attention. Synchrony between frontal and parietal areas was stronger in lower frequencies during top-down attention and in higher frequencies during bottom-up  attention. This result indicates that top-down and bottom-up signals arise from the frontal and sensory cortex respectively and different modes of attention may emphasize synchrony at different frequencies.",10.1126/science.1138071
0,Optogenetic techniques provide an unprecedented ability to precisely manipulate neural activity in the context of complex neural circuitry. Although the toolbox  of optogenetic probes continues to expand at a rapid pace with more efficient and responsive reagents hardware-based light delivery is still a major hurdle that limits its practical use in vivo. We have bypassed the challenges of external light delivery by directly coupling a bioluminescent light source (a genetically  encoded luciferase) to an inhibitory opsin which we term an inhibitory luminopsin (iLMO). iLMO was shown to suppress action potential firing and synchronous bursting activity in vitro in response to both external light and luciferase substrate. iLMO was further shown to suppress single-unit firing rate  and local field potentials in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. Finally expression of iLMO was scaled up to multiple structures of the basal ganglia to modulate rotational behavior of freely moving animals in a hardware-independent fashion. This novel class of optogenetic probes demonstrates how non-invasive inhibition of neural activity can be achieved which adds to the versatility scalability and practicality of optogenetic applications in freely behaving animals.,10.1038/srep14366
0,Most mammals possess high-resolution visual perception with primary visual cortices containing fine-scale inter-related feature representations (for example orientation and ocular dominance). Rats lack precise vision but their vibrissa sensory system provides a precise tactile modality including vibrissa-related 'barrel' columns in primary somatosensory cortex. Here we examined the subcolumnar organization of direction preference and somatotopy using a new omni-directional multi-vibrissa stimulator. We discovered a direction map that was systematically linked to somatotopy such that neurons were tuned for motion toward their preferred surround vibrissa. This sub-barrel column direction map demonstrated an emergent refinement from layer IV to layer II/III. These data suggest that joint processing of multiple sensory features is  a common property of high-resolution sensory systems.,10.1038/nn1671

0,When pressure is applied to a localized area of the body for an extended time the resulting loss of blood flow and subsequent reperfusion to the tissue causes  cell death and a pressure ulcer develops. Preventing pressure ulcers is challenging because the combination of pressure and time that results in tissue damage varies widely between patients and the underlying damage is often severe  by the time a surface wound becomes visible. Currently no method exists to detect early tissue damage and enable intervention. Here we demonstrate a flexible electronic device that non-invasively maps pressure-induced tissue damage even when such damage cannot be visually observed. Using impedance spectroscopy across flexible electrode arrays in vivo on a rat model we find that impedance is robustly correlated with tissue health across multiple animals  and wound types. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of an automated non-invasive 'smart bandage' for early detection of pressure ulcers.,10.1038/ncomms7575

0,One limitation to the use of neuroprosthestic devices for chronic application in the treatment of disease is the reactive cell responses that occur surrounding the device after insertion. These cell and tissue responses result in increases in device impedance and failure of the device to interact with target populations of neurons. However few tools are available to assess which components of the reactive response contribute most to changes in tissue impedance. An in vitro culture system has been developed that is capable of assessing individual components of the reactive response. The system utilizes alginate cell encapsulation to construct three-dimensional architectures that approach the cell densities found in rat cortex. The system was constructed around neuroNexus acute probes with on-board circuitry capable of monitoring the electrical properties of the surrounding tissue. This study demonstrates the utility of the system by demonstrating that differences in cell density within the three-dimensional alginate constructs result in differences in resistance and capacitance as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We propose that this system can be used to model components of the reactive responses in brain tissue and that the measurements recorded in vitro are comparable to measurements recorded in vivo.,10.1088/1741-2560/4/4/006
0,The surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal that originates in the muscle is inevitably contaminated by various noise signals or artifacts that originate at the skin-electrode interface in the electronics that amplifies the signals and  in external sources. Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these noises but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that contaminate the low-frequency part of the sEMG frequency spectrum. There are many factors which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate filter specifications to remove these artifacts; they include the muscle tested and type of contraction the sensor configuration and specific noise source. The band-pass determination is always a compromise between (a) reducing noise and artifact contamination and (b) preserving the desired information from the sEMG signal. This study was designed to investigate the effects of mechanical perturbations and noise that are typically encountered during sEMG recordings in clinical and related applications. The analysis established the relationship between the attenuation rates of the movement artifact and the sEMG signal as a function of the filter band pass. When this relationship is combined with other considerations related to the informational content of the signal the signal distortion of filters and the kinds of artifacts evaluated in this study a Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz and a slope of 12 dB/oct is recommended for general use. The results of this study are relevant to biomechanical and clinical applications where the measurements of body dynamics and kinematics may include artifact sources.,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.01.027
0,The value of electromyography (EMG) is sensitive to many physiological and non-physiological factors. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the torque-velocity test (T-V) can be used to normalize EMG signals into a framework of biological significance. Peak EMG amplitude of gluteus maximus (GMAX) vastus lateralis (VL) rectus femoris (RF) biceps femoris long head (BF) gastrocnemius medialis (GAS) and soleus (SOL) was calculated for nine subjects during isometric maximal voluntary contractions (IMVC) and torque-velocity bicycling tests (T-V). Then the reference EMG signals obtained from IMVC and T-V bicycling tests were used to normalize the amplitude of the EMG signals collected for 15 different submaximal pedaling conditions. The results of this study showed that the repeatability of the measurements between IMVC (from 10% to 23%) and T-V (from 8% to 20%) was comparable. The amplitude of the peak EMG of VL was 99+/-43% higher (p<0.001) when measured during T-V. Moreover the inter-individual variability of the EMG patterns calculated for submaximal cycling exercises differed significantly when using T-V bicycling normalization method (GMAX: 0.33+/-0.16 vs. 1.09+/-0.04 VL: 0.07+/-0.02 vs. 0.64+/-0.14 SOL:  0.07+/-0.03 vs. 1.00+/-0.07 RF: 1.21+/-0.20 vs. 0.92+/-0.13 BF: 1.47+/-0.47 vs. 0.84+/-0.11). It was concluded that T-V bicycling test offers the advantage to be less time and energy-consuming and to be as repeatable as IMVC tests to measure peak EMG amplitude. Furthermore this normalization method avoids the impact of non-physiological factors on the amplitude of the EMG signals so that it allows quantifying better the activation level of lower limb muscles and the variability of the EMG patterns during submaximal bicycling exercises.,10.1016/j.jelekin.2007.03.008
0,Electromyograms (EMGs) need to be normalized if comparisons are sought between trials when electrodes are reapplied as well as between different muscles and individuals. The methods used to normalize EMGs recorded from healthy individuals have been appraised for more than a quarter of a century. Eight methods were identified and reviewed based on criteria relating to their ability to facilitate the comparison of EMGs. Such criteria included the magnitude and pattern of the normalized EMG reliability and inter-individual variability. If the aim is to reduce inter-individual variability then the peak or mean EMG from the task under investigation should be used as the normalization reference value. However the ability of such normalization methods to facilitate comparisons of EMGs is questionable. EMGs from MVCs can be as reliable as those from submaximal contractions and do not appear to be affected by contraction mode or joint kinematics particularly for the elbow flexors. Thus the EMG from an isometric MVC is endorsed as a normalization reference value. Alternatively the EMG from a  dynamic MVC can be used although it is recognized that neither method is guaranteed to be able to reveal how active a muscle is in relation to its maximal activation capacity.,10.1016/j.jelekin.2010.07.004
0,We evaluated possible methods of normalising EMG measured during running. MVC Sprint and 70% Peak Running Speed methods were evaluated and their repeatability reliability and sensitivity to incremental running speed were compared. Twelve runners performed the same experimental protocol on three separate occasions. Each day subjects firstly performed MVCs followed by a 20 m maximal sprint (with a 20-30 m run-up). Following this they performed the peak running speed (PRS) test until exhaustion. After which they ran at 70% of PRS for 5 laps. Results indicated that normalising EMG data to MVC and Sprint methods are more repeatable for VM BF MG and RF VL LG respectively with the average ICC>0.80. The 70% PRS demonstrated poor to fair levels of repeatability ranging between ICC 0.27 and 0.70. Whereas the 70% PRS method had the least intra-subject variability and the greatest sensitivity to increasing running speeds. More specifically demonstrating significant changes in muscle activity in VM with increasing running speed while MVC and Sprint methods were unable to detect these changes. The dynamic methods were the most appropriate for EMG normalisation showing repeatability better intra-subject reliability and better sensitivity during running over different days and for once-off measurements.,10.1016/j.jelekin.2011.03.009

0,Falls due to slipping are a serious concern with slipping estimated to cause 40-50% of all fall-related injuries. Epidemiological data indicates that older and obese adults experience more falls than young non-obese individuals. An increasingly heavier and older U.S. population and workforce may be exacerbating  the problem of slip-induced falls. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity and age on slip severity and rate of falling resulting from laboratory-induced slips. Four groups of participants (young obese young non-obese older obese older non-obese) were slipped while walking at a self-selected slightly hurried pace. Slip severity (slip distance slip duration mean slip speed and peak slip speed) and slip outcome (fall or recovery) were compared between groups. Obese individuals experienced 22% faster  slips than non-obese individuals in terms of mean slip speed (p=0.022). Obesity did not affect slip distance slip duration or peak slip speed. Obese individuals also exhibited a higher rate of falls; 32% of obese individuals fell compared to  10% of non-obese (p=0.005). Obese individuals were more than eight times more likely to experience a fall than non-obese individuals when adjusting for age gender and gait speed. No age effects were found for slip severity or slip outcome. These results along with epidemiological data reporting higher fall rates among the obese indicate that obesity may be a significant risk factor for experiencing slip-induced falls. Slip severity thresholds were also reported that may have value in developing controls for fall prevention.,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.01.018

0,BACKGROUND: Vertigo is a debilitating disease that is commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Diazepam and meclizine are oral medications that are commonly used to alleviate symptoms. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether meclizine or diazepam is superior in the treatment of patients with peripheral vertigo in the ED. METHODS: We performed a double-blind clinical trial at a suburban teaching ED. We randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral vertigo (APV) to diazepam 5 mg or meclizine 25 mg orally. Demographic and historical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded  their initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and after 30 min (t30) and 60 min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean change in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated that a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% power to detect a difference of 20 mm between treatment groups. RESULTS: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine group. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and presenting signs and symptoms. At t60 the mean improvements in the diazepam and  meclizine groups were 36 and 40 respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence interval -20 to 12; p = 0.60). CONCLUSION: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.,10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.09.016
0,BACKGROUND: The Mortality in Severe Sepsis in the Emergency Department (MISSED) score is a newly proposed scoring system. The goal of this study is to determine  if the MISSED score is generalizable to an urban tertiary care hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review conducted from July 2012 to June 2014. Inclusion criteria consisted of adult emergency department (ED) patients with severe sepsis defined as lactate level 4mmol/L or greater. Demographics lactate international normalized ratio (INR) albumin intensive care unit admission and ED intubation were analyzed using χ(2) test t test and logistic  regression. The MISSED score was calculated using the variables albumin 27g/L or  less INR 1.3 or greater and age 65years or older and analyzed using the area under the curve. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients met inclusion criteria and mortality was 32%. Patients in the mortality group had older age (58.1±17.2 vs 62.7±14.7; P=.07) higher lactate (5.9±2.7 vs 7.3±3.1; P<.01) lower albumin (34.3±8.3 vs 25.6±7.1;  P<.0001) higher INR (1.4±0.6 vs 2.4±1.9; P<.0001) ED intubation (21% vs 56%; P<.0001) and intensive care unit admission (41% vs 78%; P<.0001). The regression model found that albumin of 27g/L or less (odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.36) INR 1.3 or greater (OR 8.3; 95% CI 3.35-20.51) and  ED intubation (OR 5.6; 95% CI 2.56-12.35) predicted mortality. The area under the curve for the MISSED score was 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.85). CONCLUSION: The MISSED score is useful for predicting mortality in ED patients with severe sepsis.,10.1016/j.ajem.2016.03.037
0,The inhibition of sensory responsivity is considered a core serotonin function yet this hypothesis lacks direct support due to methodological obstacles. We adapted an optogenetic approach to induce acute robust and specific firing of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons. In vitro the responsiveness of individual dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons to trains of light pulses varied with frequency and intensity as well as between cells and the photostimulation protocol was therefore adjusted to maximize their overall output rate. In vivo the photoactivation of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons gave rise to a prominent light-evoked field response that displayed some sensitivity to a 5-HT1A agonist  consistent with autoreceptor inhibition of raphe neurons. In behaving mice the photostimulation of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons produced a rapid and reversible decrease in the animals' responses to plantar stimulation providing a new level of evidence that serotonin gates sensory-driven responses.,10.1371/journal.pone.0105941
0,The Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase (MELK) has been reported to be a genetic dependency in several cancer types. MELK RNAi and small-molecule inhibitors of MELK block the proliferation of various cancer cell lines and MELK knockdown has been described as particularly effective against the highly-aggressive basal/triple-negative subtype of breast cancer. Based on these  preclinical results the MELK inhibitor OTS167 is currently being tested as a novel chemotherapy agent in several clinical trials. Here we report that mutagenizing MELK with CRISPR/Cas9 has no effect on the fitness of basal breast cancer cell lines or cell lines from six other cancer types. Cells that harbor null mutations in MELK exhibit wild-type doubling times cytokinesis and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore MELK-knockout lines remain sensitive to OTS167 suggesting that this drug blocks cell division through an off-target mechanism. In total our results undermine the rationale for a series of current  clinical trials and provide an experimental approach for the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in preclinical target validation that can be broadly applied.,10.7554/elife.24179
0,N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are expressed abundantly in the brain and play an important role in the regulation of neuronal development learning memory neurodegenerative diseases and neurogenesis all of which are extensively discussed in reviews published elsewhere. While the number of research articles on the developmental and neurological cues that trigger NMDAR localization across a developing neuron and the role of the NMDAR in embryonic and adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation have been growing dramatically over the past few years there is not a single review on this latter general topic. In the proposed review we will summarize the current understanding of NMDARs in stem cell biology and their involvement in pathophysiological processes of neuron development especially during early neuronal development (immature neurons) and differentiation.,10.1089/scd.2016.0325
0,Endogenous dynorphin signaling via the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) powerfully mediates negative affective states and stress reactivity. Excitatory inputs from the hippocampus and amygdala play a fundamental role in shaping the activity of both NAcc D1 and D2 MSNs which encode positive and negative motivational valences respectively. However a circuit-based mechanism by which KOR modulation of excitation-inhibition balance  modifies D1 and D2 MSN activity is lacking. Here we provide a comprehensive synaptic framework wherein presynaptic KOR inhibition decreases the excitatory drive of D1 MSN activity by the amygdala but not the hippocampus. Conversely presynaptic inhibition by KORs of inhibitory synapses on D2 MSNs enhances integration of excitatory drive by the amygdala and hippocampus. In conclusion we describe a circuit-based mechanism showing differential gating of afferent control of D1 and D2 MSN activity by KORs in a pathway-specific manner.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.005

We present a case of a 7-year-old boy with asymmetrical (mainly right hemibody) and abnormal polymorphic movements without concomitant scalpictal EEG changes but had background slowing predominating over the left hemisphere. This report illustrates previous descriptions of asymmetric presentation of abnormal movements in pediatric anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and emphasizes the importance of video-EEG interpreted within the overall clinical context to differentiate epileptic from non-epileptic abnormal movements in patients with autoimmune encephalitis.,10.1016/j.ebcr.2016.12.002
0,During tactile perception long-range intracortical top-down axonal projections are essential for processing sensory information. Whether these projections regulate sleep-dependent long-term memory consolidation is unknown. We altered top-down inputs from higher-order cortex to sensory cortex during sleep and examined the consolidation of memories acquired earlier during awake texture perception. Mice learned novel textures and consolidated them during sleep. Within the first hour of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep optogenetic inhibition of top-down projecting axons from secondary motor cortex (M2) to primary somatosensory cortex (S1) impaired sleep-dependent reactivation of S1 neurons and memory consolidation. In NREM sleep and sleep-deprivation states closed-loop asynchronous or synchronous M2-S1 coactivation respectively reduced or prolonged memory retention. Top-down cortical information flow in NREM sleep is thus required for perceptual memory consolidation.,10.1126/science.aaf0902
0,Cholinergic neurotransmission affects decision-making notably through the modulation of perceptual processing in the cortex. In addition acetylcholine acts on value-based decisions through as yet unknown mechanisms. We found that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are involved in the translation of expected uncertainty into motivational value. We developed a multi-armed bandit task for mice with three locations each associated with a different reward probability. We found that mice lacking the nAChR β2 subunit showed less uncertainty-seeking than their wild-type counterparts. Using model-based analysis we found that reward uncertainty motivated wild-type mice but not mice lacking the nAChR β2 subunit.  Selective re-expression of the β2 subunit in the VTA was sufficient to restore spontaneous bursting activity in dopamine neurons and uncertainty-seeking. Our results reveal an unanticipated role for subcortical nAChRs in motivation induced by expected uncertainty and provide a parsimonious account for a wealth of behaviors related to nAChRs in the VTA expressing the β2 subunit.,10.1038/nn.4223
0,Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene (HTT) encoding the huntingtin protein (HTT). This mutation leads to multiple cellular and synaptic alterations that are mimicked in many current HD animal models. However the most commonly used well-characterized HD models do not accurately reproduce the genetics of human disease. Recently a new 'humanized' mouse model termed Hu97/18 has been developed that genetically recapitulates human HD including two human HTT alleles no mouse Hdh alleles and heterozygosity of the HD mutation. Previously  behavioral and neuropathological testing in Hu97/18 mice revealed many features of HD yet no electrophysiological measures were employed to investigate possible synaptic alterations. Here we describe electrophysiological changes in the striatum and hippocampus of the Hu97/18 mice. At 9 months of age a stage when cognitive deficits are fully developed and motor dysfunction is also evident Hu97/18 striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) exhibited small changes in membrane properties and lower amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs); however release probability from presynaptic terminals was unaltered. Strikingly these mice also exhibited a profound deficiency in long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-to-CA1 synapses. In contrast at 6 months of age we found only subtle alterations in SPN synaptic transmission while 3-month old animals did not display any electrophysiologically detectable changes in the striatum and CA1 LTP was intact. Together these data reveal robust progressive deficits in synaptic function and plasticity in Hu97/18 mice consistent with previously reported behavioral abnormalities and suggest an optimal age (9 months) for future electrophysiological assessment in preclinical  studies of HD.,10.1371/journal.pone.0094562
0,The existence of a primitive CNS function involved in the activation of all vertebrate behaviors generalized arousal (GA) has been proposed. Here we provide an overview of the neuroanatomical neurophysiological and molecular properties of reticular neurons within the nucleus gigantocellularis (NGC) of the mammalian medulla and propose that the properties of these neurons equip them to contribute powerfully to GA. We also explore the hypothesis that these neurons may have evolved from the Mauthner cell in the medulla of teleost fish although  NGC neurons have a wider range of action far beyond the specific escape network served by Mauthner cells. Understanding the neuronal circuits that control and regulate GA is central to understanding how motivated behaviors such as hunger thirst and sexual behaviors arise.,10.1016/j.tins.2012.04.008
0,The study of consciousness is poised today at interesting crossroads. There has been a surge of research into various neurobiological underpinnings of consciousness in the past decade. The present article looks at the theories regarding this complex phenomenon especially the ones that neurobiology cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology have to offer. We will first discuss the origin and etymology of word consciousness and its usage. Neurobiological correlates of consciousness are discussed with structures like the ascending reticular activating system the amygdala the cerebellum the thalamus the frontoparietal circuits the prefrontal cortex and the precuneus. The cellular and microlevel theories of consciousness and cerebral activity at the neuronal level contributing to consciousness are highlighted along with the  various theories posited in this area. The role of neuronal assemblies and circuits along with firing patterns and their ramifications for the understanding of consciousness are discussed. A section on the role of anaesthesia and its links to consciousness is presented along with details of split-brain studies in consciousness and altered states of awareness including the vegetative states. The article finally discusses the progress cognitive psychology has made in identifying and theorising various perspectives of consciousness perceptual awareness and conscious processing. Both recent and past researches are highlighted. The importance and salient features of each theory are discussed along with the pitfalls if present. A need for integration of various theories to understand consciousness from a holistic perspective is stressed to enable one to reach a theory that explains the ultimate neurobiology of consciousness.,10.4103/0973-1229.109335

0,KEY POINTS: Electrical synapses are modified by various forms of activity including paired activity in coupled neurons and tetanization of the input to coupled neurons. We show that plasticity of electrical synapses that results from paired spiking activity in coupled neurons depends on calcium influx and calcium-initiated signalling pathways. Plasticity that results from tetanization  of input fibres does not depend on calcium influx or dynamics. These results imply that electrically coupled neurons have distinct sets of mechanisms for adjusting coupling according to the specific type of activity they experience. ABSTRACT: Recent results have demonstrated modification of electrical synapse strength by varied forms of neuronal activity. However the mechanisms underlying plasticity induction in central mammalian neurons are unclear. Here we show that  the two established inductors of plasticity at electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus - paired burst spiking in coupled neurons and mGluR-dependent tetanization of synaptic input - are separate pathways that converge at a common downstream endpoint. Using occlusion experiments and pharmacology in patched pairs of coupled neurons in vitro we show that burst-induced depression depends on calcium entry via voltage-gated channels is  blocked by BAPTA chelation and recruits intracellular calcium release on its way to activation of phosphatase activity. In contrast mGluR-dependent plasticity is independent of calcium entry or calcium dynamics. Together these results show that the spiking-initiated mechanisms underlying electrical synapse plasticity are similar to those that induce plasticity at chemical synapses and offer the possibility that calcium-regulated mechanisms may also lead to alternate outcomes such as potentiation. Because these mechanistic elements are widely found in mature neurons we expect them to apply broadly to electrical synapses across the brain acting as the crucial link between neuronal activity and electrical synapse strength.,10.1113/jp274049
0,BACKGROUND: Although several observational studies have consistently reported an  inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) it is yet not well established if this association also exists among people with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the frequency and quantity of alcohol intake and the risk of developing CHD among postmenopausal women with diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study which included 3198 women with self-reported diabetes and without any history of cardiovascular disease at baseline in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. Alcohol intake was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The primary outcome of this study was CHD which was validated by medical record review. Cox  proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the association of alcohol intake and risk of incident CHD while adjusting for several potential confounders. RESULTS: During the 22546 person-years of follow-up there were 336 incident cases of CHD. Both frequency and quantity of alcohol intake were inversely associated with the risk of developing CHD. Compared to nondrinkers the multivariable HRs across categories of frequency of alcohol consumption (<or=0.5 0.5-2 and >or=2 drinks/week) were 0.89 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.63 1.26) 0.84 (95% CI: 0.56 1.25) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.43 0.99) respectively (p for trend: 0.04). This association did not appear to differ based on the type of  the alcoholic beverage consumed. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate alcohol consumption of postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes may have a benefit on CHD similar to that seen in postmenopausal nondiabetic women. The potential risks of alcohol on noncardiac outcomes may need consideration when recommending alcohol to women with diabetes.,10.1007/s00394-009-0065-3

0,Neurons in the primary auditory cortex are tuned to the intensity and specific frequencies of sounds but the synaptic mechanisms underlying this tuning remain  uncertain. Inhibition seems to have a functional role in the formation of cortical receptive fields because stimuli often suppress similar or neighbouring responses and pharmacological blockade of inhibition broadens tuning curves. Here we use whole-cell recordings in vivo to disentangle the roles of excitatory  and inhibitory activity in the tone-evoked responses of single neurons in the auditory cortex. The excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields cover almost exactly the same areas in contrast to the predictions of classical lateral inhibition models. Thus although inhibition is typically as strong as excitation it is not necessary to establish tuning even in the receptive field  surround. However inhibition and excitation occurred in a precise and stereotyped temporal sequence: an initial barrage of excitatory input was rapidly quenched by inhibition truncating the spiking response within a few (1-4) milliseconds. Balanced inhibition might thus serve to increase the temporal precision and thereby reduce the randomness of cortical operation rather than to increase noise as has been proposed previously.,10.1038/nature02116
0,Attention has been found to have a wide variety of effects on the responses of neurons in visual cortex. We describe a model of attention that exhibits each of  these different forms of attentional modulation depending on the stimulus conditions and the spread (or selectivity) of the attention field in the model. The model helps reconcile proposals that have been taken to represent alternative theories of attention. We argue that the variety and complexity of the results reported in the literature emerge from the variety of empirical protocols that were used such that the results observed in any one experiment depended on the stimulus conditions and the subject's attentional strategy a notion that we define precisely in terms of the attention field in the model but that has not typically been completely under experimental control.,10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.002
0,Electrical stimulation through multi-electrode arrays is used to evoke activity in dissociated cultures of cortical neurons. We study the efficacies of a variety of pulse shapes under voltage control as well as current control and determine useful parameter ranges that optimize efficacy while preventing damage through electrochemistry. For any pulse shape stimulation is found to be mediated by negative currents. We find that positive-then-negative biphasic voltage-controlled pulses are more effective than any of the other pulse shapes tested when compared at the same peak voltage. These results suggest that voltage-control with its inherent control over limiting electrochemistry may be advantageous in a wide variety of stimulation scenarios possibly extending to in-vivo experiments.,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.03.005
0,Midbrain dopamine neurons signal reward prediction error (RPE) or actual minus expected reward. The temporal difference (TD) learning model has been a cornerstone in understanding how dopamine RPEs could drive associative learning.  Classically TD learning imparts value to features that serially track elapsed time relative to observable stimuli. In the real world however sensory stimuli  provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment leading  to the proposal that TD learning might instead compute a value signal based on an inferred distribution of hidden states (a 'belief state'). Here we asked whether  dopaminergic signaling supports a TD learning framework that operates over hidden states. We found that dopamine signaling showed a notable difference between two  tasks that differed only with respect to whether reward was delivered in a deterministic manner. Our results favor an associative learning rule that combines cached values with hidden-state inference.,10.1038/nn.4520
0,The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for  artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of  evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce  a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.,10.1038/nature16961
0,In an awake state neurons in the cerebral cortex fire irregularly and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings display low-amplitude high-frequency fluctuations. During sleep neurons oscillate between 'on' periods when they fire as in an awake brain and 'off' periods when they stop firing altogether and the EEG displays high-amplitude slow waves. However what happens to neuronal firing after a long period of being awake is not known. Here we show that in freely behaving rats after a long period in an awake state cortical neurons can  go briefly 'offline' as in sleep accompanied by slow waves in the local EEG. Neurons often go offline in one cortical area but not in another and during these periods of 'local sleep' the incidence of which increases with the duration of the awake state rats are active and display an 'awake' EEG. However they are progressively impaired in a sugar pellet reaching task. Thus although both the EEG and behaviour indicate wakefulness local populations of neurons in  the cortex may be falling asleep with negative consequences for performance.,10.1038/nature10009
0,Sleep is an essential behavioral state. It is induced by conserved sleep-active neurons that express GABA. However little is known about how sleep neuron function is determined and how sleep neurons change physiology and behavior systemically. Here we investigated sleep in Caenorhabditis elegans which is induced by the single sleep-active neuron RIS. We found that the transcription factor LIM-6 which specifies GABAergic function in parallel determines sleep neuron function through the expression of APTF-1 which specifies the expression  of FLP-11 neuropeptides. Surprisingly FLP-11 and not GABA is the major component that determines the sleep-promoting function of RIS. FLP-11 is constantly expressed in RIS.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if gabapentin a widely prescribed generic calcium channel/γ-aminobutyric acid-modulating medication increases rates of sustained abstinence and no heavy drinking and decreases alcohol-related insomnia dysphoria and craving in a dose-dependent manner. DESIGN PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized dose-ranging trial of 150 men and women older than 18 years with current alcohol dependence conducted from 2004 through 2010 at a single-site outpatient clinical research facility adjoining a general medical hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Oral gabapentin (dosages of 0 [placebo] 900 mg or 1800 mg/d) and concomitant manual-guided counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of complete abstinence and no heavy drinking (coprimary) and changes in mood sleep and craving (secondary) over the 12-week  study. RESULTS Gabapentin significantly improved the rates of abstinence and no heavy drinking. The abstinence rate was 4.1% (95% CI 1.1%-13.7%) in the placebo  group 11.1% (95% CI 5.2%-22.2%) in the 900-mg group and 17.0% (95% CI 8.9%-30.1%) in the 1800-mg group (P = .04 for linear dose effect; number needed to treat [NNT] = 8 for 1800 mg). The no heavy drinking rate was 22.5% (95% CI 13.6%-37.2%) in the placebo group 29.6% (95% CI 19.1%-42.8%) in the 900-mg group and 44.7% (95% CI 31.4%-58.8%) in the 1800-mg group (P = .02 for linear dose effect; NNT = 5 for 1800 mg). Similar linear dose effects were obtained with measures of mood (F2 = 7.37; P = .001) sleep (F2 = 136; P < .001) and craving (F2 = 3.56; P = .03). There were no serious drug-related adverse events and terminations owing to adverse events (9 of 150 participants) time in the study (mean [SD] 9.1 [3.8] weeks) and rate of study completion (85 of 150 participants) did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Gabapentin (particularly the 1800-mg dosage) was effective in treating alcohol dependence and relapse-related symptoms of insomnia dysphoria and craving with a favorable safety profile. Increased implementation of pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence in primary care may be a major benefit of gabapentin as a treatment option for alcohol dependence.

0,Activity-dependent plasticity including short and long-term depression accompanied by a reduction in transmitter release probability has been demonstrated in both inhibitory and excitatory synapses. In the neonatal hippocampus repetitive postsynaptic depolarization is followed by presynaptic alterations of the efficacy of GABAAergic transmission. Both facilitation and inhibition have been observed but the mechanisms underlying this plasticity have not yet been elucidated. In the present experiment repetitive postsynaptic depolarization by itself did not cause marked alterations of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). Activation of presynaptic neurons by increasing extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) temporarily induced facilitation of sIPSCs but successive repetitive depolarizations transiently reduced the current frequency. This newly discovered inhibition was expressed presynaptically could not be induced by postsynaptic depolarization alone and was facilitated by the activation of NMDA receptors. IPSC inhibition was suppressed using the antagonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) or  muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). Furthermore transient inhibition was reduced  by an antagonist of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1 receptor). The effect of CB1 receptor agonist on the sIPSCs was potentiated by [K+]o elevation implying a role for the [K+]o elevation other than the release of transmitters. These results show that weak postsynaptic activation when combined with presynaptic activation leads to an inhibition of GABAergic synapses in the neonatal hippocampus. This inhibition is mediated by a mechanism involving mGluRs mAChRs and CB1 receptors and potentiated by NMDA receptor activation.,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.04.022
0,"Improvements in enumeration abilities that emerge over late childhood are primarily thought to reflect perceptual developments such as increases in subitizing limits for small sets and faster shifting of attention associated with serially counting larger sets. Contributions of conceptual knowledge development such as the growing appreciation of how whole numbers are composed of subsets of  whole numbers are not as well understood. This study examined the emergence of a process referred to as ""groupitizing"" which captures how children may capitalize on grouping information to facilitate enumeration processes. We examined enumeration speed in a cross-sectional sample of children (N=378) spanning kindergarten through third grade using arrays of dots. Arrays were either unstructured or grouped by proximity into subsets in the subitizing range (i.e.  three subgroups of 1-3 items). Kindergarten children showed no evidence of grouping structure on enumeration. First-grade children enumerated grouped arrays faster than unstructured arrays. This structure effect grew progressively stronger in subsequent grades. Enumeration speed for unstructured arrays increased with set size yet for grouped arrays the impact of set size was dependent on grade level. For kindergartners the grouping manipulation had no impact on the effect of set size. For older children the grouping manipulation reduced the effect of set size on enumeration. Furthermore individual differences in how set size affected enumeration of grouped arrays showed unique  patterns of association with performance on standardized symbolic arithmetic fluency tests suggesting a unique role for the construct of groupitizing in the  development of enumeration fluency and symbolic math skills.",10.1016/j.jecp.2014.03.006

0,Interest in circulating RNAs for monitoring and diagnosing human health has grown significantly. There are few datasets describing baseline expression levels for total cell-free circulating RNA from healthy control subjects. In this study total extracellular RNA (exRNA) was isolated and sequenced from 183 plasma samples 204 urine samples and 46 saliva samples from 55 male college athletes ages 18-25 years. Many participants provided more than one sample allowing us to investigate variability in an individual's exRNA expression levels over time. Here we provide a systematic analysis of small exRNAs present in each biofluid as well as an analysis of exogenous RNAs. The small RNA profile of each biofluid  is distinct. We find that a large number of RNA fragments in plasma (63%) and urine (54%) have sequences that are assigned to YRNA and tRNA fragments respectively. Surprisingly while many miRNAs can be detected there are few miRNAs that are consistently detected in all samples from a single biofluid and  profiles of miRNA are different for each biofluid. Not unexpectedly saliva samples have high levels of exogenous sequence that can be traced to bacteria. These data significantly contribute to the current number of sequenced exRNA samples from normal healthy individuals.,10.1038/srep44061
0,Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has been used in eukaryotic cell cultures for decades. However little attention has been paid to the biological effects associated with RNA content of FBS on cell cultures. Here using RNA sequencing we demonstrate that FBS contains a diverse repertoire of protein-coding and regulatory RNA species including mRNA miRNA rRNA and snoRNA. The majority of them (>70%) are retained even after extended ultracentrifugation in the preparations of vesicle-depleted FBS (vdFBS) commonly utilized in the studies of extracellular vesicles (EV) and intercellular communication. FBS-associated RNA is co-isolated  with cell-culture derived extracellular RNA (exRNA) and interferes with the downstream RNA analysis. Many evolutionally conserved FBS-derived RNA species can be falsely annotated as human or mouse transcripts. Notably specific miRNAs abundant in FBS such as miR-122 miR-451a and miR-1246 have been previously reported as enriched in cell-culture derived EVs possibly due to the confounding effect of the FBS. Analysis of publically available exRNA datasets supports the notion of FBS contamination. Furthermore FBS transcripts can be taken up by cultured cells and affect the results of highly sensitive gene expression profiling technologies. Therefore precautions for experimental design are warranted to minimize the interference and misinterpretations caused by FBS-derived RNA.,10.1038/srep31175

0,Translating advances in neuroscience into benefits for patients with mental illness presents enormous challenges because it involves both the most complex organ the brain and its interaction with a similarly complex environment. Dealing with such complexities demands powerful techniques. Computational psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types  of data in an effort to improve understanding prediction and treatment of mental illness. Computational psychiatry broadly defined encompasses two complementary approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of disease predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven  approaches in contrast use models that instantiate prior knowledge of or explicit hypotheses about such mechanisms possibly at multiple levels of analysis and abstraction. We review recent advances in both approaches with an emphasis on clinical applications and highlight the utility of combining them.,10.1038/nn.4238

0,Although interactions between the thalamus and cortex are critical for cognitive  function the exact contribution of the thalamus to these interactions remains unclear. Recent studies have shown diverse connectivity patterns across the thalamus but whether this diversity translates to thalamic functions beyond relaying information to or between cortical regions is unknown. Here we show by  investigating the representation of two rules used to guide attention in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) that the mediodorsal thalamus sustains these representations without relaying categorical information. Specifically mediodorsal input amplifies local PFC connectivity enabling rule-specific neural sequences to emerge and thereby maintain rule representations. Consistent with this notion broadly enhancing PFC excitability diminishes rule specificity and behavioural performance whereas enhancing mediodorsal excitability improves both. Overall our results define a previously unknown principle in neuroscience; thalamic control of functional cortical connectivity. This function which is dissociable from categorical information relay indicates that the thalamus has a much broader role in cognition than previously thought.,10.1038/nature22073
0,Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is caused by diminished Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein leading to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction and spinal motor neuron (MN) loss. Here we report that reduced SMN function impacts the action of a pertinent microRNA and its mRNA target in MNs. Loss of the C. elegans SMN ortholog SMN-1 causes NMJ defects. We found that increased levels of the C. elegans Gemin3 ortholog MEL-46 ameliorates these defects. Increased MEL-46 levels also restored perturbed microRNA (miR-2) function in smn-1(lf) animals. We determined that miR-2 regulates expression of the C. elegans M2 muscarinic receptor (m2R) ortholog GAR-2. GAR-2 loss ameliorated smn-1(lf) and mel-46(lf) synaptic defects. In an SMA mouse model m2R levels were increased and pharmacological inhibition of m2R rescued MN process defects. Collectively these results suggest decreased SMN leads to defective microRNA function via MEL-46 misregulation followed by increased m2R expression and neuronal dysfunction in  SMA.,10.7554/elife.20752
0,Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role in cortical computation empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically  identified pyramidal cells and interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat in a working memory task. On broader timescales sequentially organized  and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects we found evidence for both firing pattern-dependent  facilitation and depression as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets.,10.1038/nn.2134
0,AIMS: We previously demonstrated that intrathecal IL-1β upregulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P-p38 MAPK) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in microglia and astrocytes in spinal cord increased nitric oxide (NO) release into cerebrospinal fluid and induced thermal hyperalgesia in rats. This study investigated the role of spinal glutamatergic response in intrathecal IL-1β-induced nociception in rats. METHODS: The pretreatment effects of MK-801 (5 μg) minocycline (20 μg) and SB203580 (5 μg) on intrathecal IL-1β (100 ng) in rats were measured by behavior  Western blotting CSF analysis and immunofluorescence studies. RESULTS: IL-1β increased phosphorylation of NR-1 (p-NR1) subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in neurons and microglia reduced glutamate transporters (GTs; glutamate/aspartate transporter by 60.9% glutamate transporter-1 by 55.0% excitatory amino acid carrier-1 by 39.8%; P<.05 for all) and increased glutamate (29%-133% increase from 1.5 to 12 hours; P<.05) and NO (44%-101% increase from 4 to 12 hours; P<.05) levels in cerebrospinal fluid. MK-801 significantly inhibited all the IL-1β-induced responses; however minocycline and SB203580 blocked the IL-1β-downregulated GTs and elevated glutamate but not the upregulated p-NR1. CONCLUSION: The enhanced glutamatergic response and neuron-glia interaction potentiate the intrathecal IL-1β-activated P-p38/iNOS/NO signaling and thermal hyperalgesia.,10.1111/cns.12705

0,The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is thought to regulate behavioral responses under emotionally arousing conditions. Reward-associated cues activate PVT neurons; however the specific PVT efferents regulating reward  seeking remain elusive. Using a cued sucrose-seeking task we manipulated PVT activity under two emotionally distinct conditions: (1) when reward was available during the cue as expected or (2) when reward was unexpectedly omitted during the cue. Pharmacological inactivation of the anterior PVT (aPVT) but not the posterior PVT increased sucrose seeking only when reward was omitted. Consistent with this photoactivation of aPVT neurons abolished sucrose seeking and the firing of aPVT neurons differentiated reward availability. Photoinhibition of aPVT projections to the nucleus accumbens or to the amygdala increased or decreased respectively sucrose seeking only when reward was omitted. Our findings suggest that PVT bidirectionally modulates sucrose seeking under the negative (frustrative) conditions of reward omission.,10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.036

0,Blood flow into the brain is dynamically regulated to satisfy the changing metabolic requirements of neurons but how this is accomplished has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate a central role for capillary endothelial cells in sensing neural activity and communicating it to upstream arterioles in the form of an electrical vasodilatory signal. We further demonstrate that this signal is  initiated by extracellular K+ -a byproduct of neural activity-which activates capillary endothelial cell inward-rectifier K+ (KIR2.1) channels to produce a rapidly propagating retrograde hyperpolarization that causes upstream arteriolar  dilation increasing blood flow into the capillary bed. Our results establish brain capillaries as an active sensory web that converts changes in external K+ into rapid 'inside-out' electrical signaling to direct blood flow to active brain regions.,10.1038/nn.4533
0,Cognitive flexibility is fundamental to adaptive intelligent behavior. Prefrontal cortex has long been associated with flexible cognitive function but the neurophysiological principles that enable prefrontal cells to adapt their response properties according to context-dependent rules remain poorly understood. Here we use time-resolved population-level neural pattern analyses to explore how context is encoded and maintained in primate prefrontal cortex and used in flexible decision making. We show that an instruction cue triggers a rapid series of state transitions before settling into a stable low-activity state. The postcue state is differentially tuned according to the current task-relevant rule. During decision making the response to a choice stimulus is  characterized by an initial stimulus-specific population response but evolves to  different final decision-related states depending on the current rule. These results demonstrate how neural tuning profiles in prefrontal cortex adapt to accommodate changes in behavioral context. Highly flexible tuning could be mediated via short-term synaptic plasticity.,10.1016/j.neuron.2013.01.039

0,Single-fluorescent protein biosensors (SFPBs) are an important class of probes that enable the single-cell quantification of analytes in vivo. Despite advantages over other detection technologies their use has been limited by the inherent challenges of their construction. Specifically the rational design of green fluorescent protein (GFP) insertion into a ligand-binding domain generating the requisite allosteric coupling remains a rate-limiting step. Here we describe an unbiased approach termed domain-insertion profiling with DNA sequencing (DIP-seq) that combines the rapid creation of diverse libraries of potential SFPBs and high-throughput activity assays to identify functional biosensors. As a proof of concept we construct an SFPB for the important regulatory sugar trehalose. DIP-seq analysis of a trehalose-binding-protein reveals allosteric hotspots for GFP insertion and results in high-dynamic range biosensors that function robustly in vivo. Taken together DIP-seq simultaneously accelerates metabolite biosensor construction and provides a novel tool for interrogating protein allostery.,10.1038/ncomms12266
0,OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a major cause of death for intensive care patients. High concentrations of inflammatory cytokines are characteristic of severe systemic inflammation and activated monocytes are their predominant cellular source. To identify targets for antiinflammatory intervention we investigated the response  of human macrophages to inflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators. METHODS AND RESULTS: We profiled gene expression in human macrophages exposed to  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-gamma in the presence or absence of recombinant activated protein C (APC) or IL-10 and identified Wnt5A as one of the transcripts most highly induced by LPS/IFN-gamma and suppressed by APC and IL-10. We confirmed regulation of Wnt5A protein in macrophages and detected it in sera and bone marrow macrophages of patients with severe sepsis. We established that a functional Wnt5A/frizzled-5/CaMKII signaling pathway was essential for macrophage inflammatory activation. To prove the essential contribution of Wnt5A we measured inflammatory cytokines after stimulation with Wnt5A silenced Wnt5A by siRNA and blocked receptor binding with soluble Frizzled-related peptide-1 (sFRP1). CONCLUSIONS: Wnt5A is critically involved in inflammatory macrophage signaling in sepsis and is a target for antiinflammatory mediators like APC or antagonists like sFRP1.,10.1161/atvbaha.107.157438

0,RATIONALE: Females have been demonstrated repeatedly to be more sensitive to cocaine. The role of the frontal cortex (FCX) in mediating behavioral sensitization and the underlying signaling pathways are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to characterize the role of FCX calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity in the behavioral supersensitization observed in female rats after prolonged cocaine exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intact female rats that received cocaine for 9 days followed by 7 days of drug withdrawal constituted the model used for studying the mechanism of supersensitization. RESULTS: This cocaine withdrawal treatment resulted in behavioral supersensitization in intact female rats as indicated by an enhanced behavioral response to cocaine challenge assessed on day 16 (7-day withdrawal) and compared  to the response on day 9 of cocaine treatment. This treatment regimen did not lead to supersensitization in male or in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Administration of estrogen to OVX rats restored behavioral supersensitivity to repeated cocaine. FCX CaMKII activity was significantly altered by cocaine in females and this effect was related to estrogen's presence; cocaine-induced changes in striatal CaMKII activity were however less estrogen-sensitive. Furthermore estrogen-modulated FCX CaMKII activity in cocaine-supersensitized rats was dependent on D(1) dopamine receptor activation. CONCLUSION: Estrogen-modulated D(1) dopamine receptor activity mediates the effects of prolonged cocaine exposure on FCX CaMKII and this in turn may contribute to the development of behavioral supersensitivity to repeated cocaine  treatment in intact female rats.,10.1007/s00213-006-0648-0
0,Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of the  catecholamines dopamine noradrenaline and adrenaline. In response to short term stimuli TH activity is primarily controlled by phosphorylation of serine 40. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of serine 19 in TH can indirectly activate TH via a hierarchical mechanism by increasing the rate of phosphorylation of serine 40. Here we show that phosphorylation of serine 31 in rat TH increases the rate of serine 40 phosphorylation 9-fold in vitro. Phosphorylation of serine 31 in intact bovine chromaffin cells potentiated the forskolin-induced increase in serine 40 phosphorylation and TH activity more than 2-fold. Humans are unique in that they contain four TH isoforms but to date no significant differences have been shown in the regulation of these isoforms. Phosphorylation of the human TH isoform 1 at serine 31 by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) also produced a 9-fold increase in the rate of phosphorylation of serine 40 whereas little effect was seen in the TH isoforms 3 and 4. ERK did not phosphorylate human TH isoform 2. The effect of serine 19 phosphorylation on serine 40 (44 in TH2) phosphorylation is stronger in TH2 than in TH1. Thus hierarchical phosphorylation provides a mechanism whereby the two major human TH isoforms (1 and 2) can be differentially regulated with only isoform 1 responding to the ERK pathway whereas isoform 2 is more sensitive to calcium-mediated events.,10.1074/jbc.m512194200
0,INTRODUCTION: Alterations in protein kinase (PKA) protein levels have been implicated in the regulation of responses to and development of cocaine addiction. However the contribution of differences in PKA intracellular cascade  to the known sex differences in responses to cocaine is not well understood. This study examined whether there are intrinsic or cocaine-induced alterations in PKA-mediated responses such as phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein in male and female rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To this end protein levels of PKA and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in the caudate putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female rats were measured basally or after acute (one 30-mg/kg intraperitoneal injection) or chronic (twice-daily 15-mg/kg injections for 14 days) cocaine administration. Behavioral responses to both cocaine administration paradigms were also studied. RESULTS: Similar to previous findings ambulatory rearing and stereotypic activities were higher in female rats after acute cocaine administration. Sex differences in cocaine-induced responses were also observed after chronic cocaine administration: While males developed a robust sensitization in ambulatory activities to cocaine females developed tolerance in cocaine-induced rearing and stereotypic activities. In the basal group females had significantly higher PKA  protein levels in the NAc. Regardless of the cocaine administration paradigm PKA protein levels in the NAc were higher overall in females than in males. Furthermore after cocaine administration while pCREB protein levels in male rats were induced for a longer amount of time than in female rats the magnitude  of change on pCREB levels were higher in female than male rats. However in the CPu no sex differences in PKA or pCREB protein levels were observed either in the basal group or after acute or chronic cocaine administration. DISCUSSION: Taken together these findings suggest that sex differences in basal  and cocaine-induced alterations in the PKA signaling regulation in the NAc may contribute to sex differences in the psychomotor responses to cocaine.,10.1007/s00213-008-1411-5
0,We have developed a method for visualizing phosphorylation of proteins in living  cells using a novel fluorescent indicator composed of two green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants joined by the kinase-inducible domain (KID) of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Phosphorylation of KID by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) decreased the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) among  the flanking GFPs. By transfecting COS-7 cells with an expression vector encoding this indicator protein (termed ART for cAMP-responsive tracer) we were able to visualize activation dynamics of PKA in living cells.,10.1038/73767

0,Existing monitoring methods for protein phosphorylation involved in intracellular signal transduction in vivo are exclusively based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer which needs the measurement of the change in fluorescence intensities at two wavelengths. Therefore it is difficult to monitor protein phosphorylation together with other related signaling processes such as second messengers and protein translocation. To overcome this problem we developed novel fluorescent indicators each containing a differently colored (cyan and green) single fluorophore. The present indicator is a tandem fusion protein containing a kinase substrate domain a circularly permuted fluorescent protein (cpFP) and a phosphorylation recognition domain. The cpFP is obtained by dividing a green fluorescent protein mutant (GFP) at residue 144-145 and linking  the carboxy and amino portions thereof with a peptide linker. The substrate domain used in this study is a peptide sequence that is phosphorylated by insulin receptor. Phosphorylation of the substrate domain induces its interaction with the phosphorylation recognition domain which causes a conformational change in the cpFP and a change in its fluorescence. The cyan and green indicators exhibited 10% decrease and 15% increase respectively in their fluorescence intensities upon phosphorylation. Using this cyan indicator and GFP-tagged mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) we found that insulin-induced protein phosphorylation occurred immediately upon the addition of insulin whereas nuclear translocation of MAPK occurred 7 min later. By tailoring the substrate domains and the phosphorylation recognition domains in these cyan and green indicators the present approach should be applicable to the in vivo analysis of  a broad range of protein phosphorylation processes together with other intracellular signaling processes.,10.1021/ac040037s
0,The power and scope of chemical synthesis offer considerable opportunities to broaden the lexicon of chemical tools that can be implemented for the study of complex biological systems. To investigate individual signaling proteins and pathways chemical tools provide a powerful complement to existing genetic chemical genetic and immunologic methods. In particular understanding phosphorylation-mediated signaling in real time yields important information about the regulation of cellular function and insights into the origin of disease. Recent advances in the development of photolabile caged analogs of bioactive species and fluorescence-based sensors of protein kinase activities are useful for investigating protein phosphorylation and the roles of phosphoproteins. Photolabile caged analogs allow spatial and temporal control over the release of a compound while fluorescence-based sensors allow the real-time visualization of kinase activity. Here we discuss recent advances that have increased the specificity and availability of these tools.,10.1016/j.tcb.2005.07.003

Genetically encoded reporters based on fluorescent proteins (FPs) are powerful tools for spatiotemporal visualization of cellular parameters. Consequently commonly used  modular biosensor designs have been adapted to generate several protein-based indicators for monitoring various PTMs or the activity of corresponding enzymes in living cells providing new biological insights into dynamics and regulatory functions of individual PTMs. In this review we describe the application of general design strategies focusing on PTMs and discuss important considerations for engineering feasible indicators depending on the purpose. Moreover we present developments and enhancements of PTM biosensors from selected studies and give an outlook on future perspectives of this versatile approach.,10.1002/bip.22254

0,Creating transgenic mice is an important technology for genetic studies and is currently performed by pronuclear microinjection of plasmid DNA into fertilized eggs. Since survival of injected embryos and integration of plasmid DNA are not efficient total efficiency is only around 3% with a standard protocol. To circumvent this problem here we describe a novel transgenesis method the Tol2-mediated cytoplasmic injection method (Tol2:CI). We injected a foreign DNA cloned in a Tol2-transposon vector together with the transposase mRNA into the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs. As expected the survival rate of the injected embryos was increased drastically. Also the foreign DNA was transposed from the  plasmid to the genome and transmitted to the next generation very efficiently. Together the overall transgenic efficiency became more than 20%. Considering its simplicity and perfect compatibility with existing pronuclear microinjection facilities we propose that the Tol2:CI method is applicable to high throughput functional genomics studies.,10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.02.006
0,"Biosensors based on the principle of Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) have shed new light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling molecules. Among them intramolecular FRET biosensors have been increasingly used due to their high sensitivity and user-friendliness. Time-consuming optimizations by trial and error however obstructed the development of intramolecular FRET biosensors. Here we report an optimized backbone for rapid development of highly  sensitive intramolecular FRET biosensors. The key concept is to exclude the ""orientation-dependent"" FRET and to render the biosensors completely ""distance-dependent"" with a long flexible linker. We optimized a pair of fluorescent proteins for distance-dependent biosensors and then developed a long flexible linker ranging from 116 to 244 amino acids in length which reduced the basal FRET signal and thereby increased the gain of the FRET biosensors. Computational simulations provided insight into the mechanisms by which this optimized system was the rational strategy for intramolecular FRET biosensors. With this backbone system we improved previously reported FRET biosensors of PKA ERK JNK EGFR/Abl Ras and Rac1. Furthermore this backbone  enabled us to develop novel FRET biosensors for several kinases of RSK S6K Akt and PKC and to perform quantitative evaluation of kinase inhibitors in living cells.",10.1091/mbc.e11-01-0072

0,Cell replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease have focused on transplantation of the cell types affected by the pathological process. Here we describe an alternative strategy for Parkinson's disease in which dopamine neurons are generated by direct conversion of astrocytes. Using three transcription factors NEUROD1 ASCL1 and LMX1A and the microRNA miR218 collectively designated NeAL218 we reprogram human astrocytes in vitro and mouse astrocytes in vivo into induced dopamine neurons (iDANs). Reprogramming efficiency in vitro is improved by small molecules that promote chromatin remodeling and activate the TGFβ Shh and Wnt signaling pathways. The reprogramming efficiency of human astrocytes reaches up to 16% resulting in iDANs with appropriate midbrain markers and excitability. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease NeAL218 alone reprograms adult striatal astrocytes into iDANs that are excitable and correct some aspects of motor behavior in vivo including gait impairments. With further optimization this approach may enable clinical therapies for Parkinson's disease by delivery of genes rather than cells.,10.1038/nbt.3835

0,Activity in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) instructs directional movements often seconds before movement initiation. It is unknown whether this preparatory activity is localized to ALM or widely distributed within motor cortex. Here we imaged activity across motor cortex while mice performed a whisker-based object localization task with a delayed directional licking response. During tactile sensation and the delay epoch object location was represented in motor cortex areas that are medial and posterior relative to ALM  including vibrissal motor cortex. Preparatory activity appeared first in deep layers of ALM seconds before the behavioral response and remained localized to  ALM until the behavioral response. Later widely distributed neurons represented  the outcome of the trial. Cortical area was more predictive of neuronal selectivity than laminar location or axonal projection target. Motor cortex therefore represents sensory motor and outcome information in a spatially organized manner.,10.1016/j.neuron.2017.05.005
0,The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found  to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information.,10.1016/j.neuron.2017.04.017
0,We report a noninvasive strategy for electrically stimulating neurons at depth. By delivering to the brain multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to recruit neural firing but which differ by a frequency within the dynamic range of neural firing we can electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region where interference between the multiple fields results in a prominent electric field envelope modulated at the difference frequency. We validated this temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and physics experiments and verified that neurons in the living mouse brain could follow the electric field envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stimulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of living mice without recruiting neurons of the overlying cortex. Finally we show that by altering the currents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes we can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living mice.,10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.024
0,Compartmentalized biochemical activities are essential to all cellular processes but there is no generalizable method to visualize dynamic protein activities in living cells at a resolution commensurate with cellular compartmentalization. Here we introduce a new class of fluorescent biosensors that detect biochemical  activities in living cells at a resolution up to threefold better than the diffraction limit. These 'FLINC' biosensors use binding-induced changes in protein fluorescence dynamics to translate kinase activities or protein-protein interactions into changes in fluorescence fluctuations which are quantifiable through stochastic optical fluctuation imaging. A protein kinase A (PKA) biosensor allowed us to resolve minute PKA activity microdomains on the plasma membranes of living cells and to uncover the role of clustered anchoring proteins in organizing these activity microdomains. Together these findings suggest that  biochemical activities of the cell are spatially organized into an activity architecture whose structural and functional characteristics can be revealed by these new biosensors.,10.1038/nmeth.4221
0,Arteriograms performed in the Interventional Management of Stroke studies were analyzed for external carotid artery embolus. Two cases were identified and diagnosed as thromboembolic due to a cardiac origin. This is an uncommon but useful finding on angiography which is helpful for further management. It is hypothesized that finding embolus within the external carotid artery on angiography in stroke patients with internal carotid artery occlusion allows confident ascription to a proximal usually cardiac source.,10.1136/jnis.2011.004846
0,Neurotransmitter release at CNS synapses occurs via both action potential-dependent and independent mechanisms and it has generally been accepted that these two forms of release are regulated in parallel. We examined the effects of activation of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)  on stimulus-evoked and spontaneous glutamate release onto entorhinal cortical neurones in rats and found a differential regulation of action potential-dependent and independent forms of release. Activation of presynaptic mGluRs depressed the amplitude of stimulus-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents but concurrently enhanced the frequency of spontaneous excitatory currents. Moreover these differential effects on glutamate release were mediated by pharmacologically separable mechanisms. Application of the specific activator  of adenylyl cyclase forskolin mimicked the effect of mGluR activation on spontaneous but not evoked release and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with 9-tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (SQ22536) blocked mGluR-mediated enhancement of spontaneous release but not depression of evoked release. Occlusion studies with calcium channel blockers suggested that the group III mGluRs might depress evoked release through inhibition of both N and P/Q but not R-type calcium channels. We suggest that the concurrent depression of action potential-evoked and enhancement of action potential-independent glutamate release operate through discrete second messenger/effector systems at excitatory  entorhinal terminals in rat brain.,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.06.002
0,OBJECTIVE: The risk of stroke in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. The purpose of this population-based propensity score-matched longitudinal follow-up study was to determine whether there is an increased risk  of ischemic stroke after PD. METHODS: We used a logistic regression model that includes age sex pre-existing comorbidities and socioeconomic status as covariates to compute the propensity score. A total of 2204 patients with at least two ambulatory visits with the principal diagnosis of PD in 2001 was enrolled in the PD group. The non- PD group consisted of 2204 propensity score-matched subjects without PD. The ischemic stroke-free survival rates of the two groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression with patients  matched on propensity score was used to estimate the effect of PD on the occurrence of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: During the three-year follow-up period 328 subjects in the PD group and 156 subjects in the non-PD group developed ischemic stroke. The ischemic stroke-free survival rate of the PD group was significantly lower than that of the non-PD group (P<0.0001). The hazard ratio (HR) of stroke for the PD group was 2.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.92 to 2.93 P<0.0001) compared to the non-  PD group. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke in PD patients. Further studies are required to investigate the underlying mechanism.,10.1371/journal.pone.0068314
0,In recent years significant progress has been made delineating the psychological  components of reward and their underlying neural mechanisms. Here we briefly highlight findings on three dissociable psychological components of reward: 'liking' (hedonic impact) 'wanting' (incentive salience) and learning (predictive associations and cognitions). A better understanding of the components of reward and their neurobiological substrates may help in devising  improved treatments for disorders of mood and motivation ranging from depression to eating disorders drug addiction and related compulsive pursuits of rewards.,10.1016/j.coph.2008.12.014
0,Methamphetamine (meth) is a potent psychostimulant known to cause neurotoxicity.  Clinical reports suggest meth abuse is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. We  investigated changes in the blood-brain barrier and cerebral vasculature as a mechanism underlying this risk in rats treated acutely and trained to self-administer meth. We observed blood-brain barrier leakage in rats treated acutely with meth. Hypoperfusion in the striatum was detected with acute and chronic meth treatment and was associated with hypoxia. This was correlated with  reductions in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase in rats trained to self-administer meth. These findings suggest a new mechanism of meth-induced neurotoxicity involving striatal vasoconstriction resulting in hypoxia and dopamine reductions  leading to an increased risk for Parkinson's disease for meth abusers.,10.1097/wnr.0b013e32834d0bc8
0,If neurobiology is ultimately to contribute to the development of successful treatments for drug addiction researchers must discover the molecular mechanisms by which drug-seeking behaviors are consolidated into compulsive use the mechanisms that underlie the long persistence of relapse risk and the mechanisms by which drug-associated cues come to control behavior. Evidence at the molecular cellular systems behavioral and computational levels of analysis is converging to suggest the view that addiction represents a pathological usurpation of the neural mechanisms of learning and memory that under normal circumstances serve to shape survival behaviors related to the pursuit of rewards and the cues that predict them. The author summarizes the converging evidence in  this area and highlights key questions that remain.,10.1176/appi.ajp.162.8.1414

0,A fundamental task of sensory systems is to extract relevant social information from a range of environmental stimuli in the face of changing behavioral contexts and reproductive states. Neuromodulatory pathways that interact with such contextual variables are 1 mechanism for achieving this. In the mouse inferior colliculus (IC) a midbrain auditory region the neuromodulator serotonin increases in females interacting with courting males but events downstream of serotonin release have not been investigated. Here we manipulated serotonin levels in female mice with the serotonin releaser fenfluramine or the serotonin depleter para-chlorophenylalaninemethyl ester (pCPA). Females were then exposed to an empty cage a male partner or a playback of courtship vocalizations and the numbers of neurons in the IC with positive immunoreactivity for the immediate early gene product c-Fos were measured. The effects of drug treatments depended on social context and estrous state. Fenfluramine had greater effects in the nonsocial than in the partner social treatments. Females in proestrus or estrus and given fenfluramine had higher densities of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons while females in diestrus had fewer immunoreactive neurons. The drug pCPA had the expected opposite effect of fenfluramine causing a decreased response in pro/estrus females and an increased response in diestrus females. These findings  show that the effects of serotonin on c-Fos activity in the IC of females is dependent on both external context and reproductive state and suggest that these effects occur downstream of serotonin release.

0,The impact of estrogen exposure in preventing or treating cardiovascular disease  is controversial. But it is clear that estrogen has important effects on vascular physiology and pathophysiology with potential therapeutic implications. Therefore the goal of this review is to summarize using an integrated approach current knowledge of the vascular effects of estrogen both in humans and in experimental animals. Aspects of estrogen synthesis and receptors as well as general mechanisms of estrogenic action are reviewed with an emphasis on issues particularly relevant to the vascular system. Recent understanding of the impact  of estrogen on mitochondrial function suggests that the longer lifespan of women  compared with men may depend in part on the ability of estrogen to decrease production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. Mechanisms by which estrogen increases endothelial vasodilator function promotes angiogenesis and modulates autonomic function are summarized. Key aspects of the relevant pathophysiology of inflammation atherosclerosis stroke migraine and thrombosis are reviewed concerning current knowledge of estrogenic effects. A number of emerging concepts are addressed throughout. These include the importance of estrogenic formulation and route of administration and the impact of genetic polymorphisms either in estrogen receptors or in enzymes responsible  for estrogen metabolism on responsiveness to hormone treatment. The importance of local metabolism of estrogenic precursors and the impact of timing for initiation of treatment and its duration are also considered. Although consensus  opinions are emphasized controversial views are presented to stimulate future research.,10.1124/pr.107.08002
0,We have found that estrogen promotes suppression of feeding and a lean body mass  while activating the arcuate nucleus proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. These neurons when activated suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. Because the increased activation of POMC neurons by estradiol was associated with increased glutamate receptor presence that enable calcium influx we analyzed the expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin in these  hypothalamic neurons. We observed that estrogen treatment of female mice resulted in induction of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity in arcuate nucleus neurons a large  number of which was POMC-expressing. These data indicate that the increased excitatory activity induced by estradiol in the arcuate nucleus in support of suppression of appetite is associated with calcium overload of these neurons. Although parvalbumin may protect these cells from calcium overload-associated neuronal degeneration maintenance of calcium entry may lead to increased vulnerability of POMC neurons during the course of sustained satiety.,10.1177/1933719110379651
0,Decision-making behavior is often characterized by substantial variability but its source remains unclear. We developed a visual accumulation of evidence task designed to quantify sources of noise and to be performed during voluntary head restraint enabling cellular resolution imaging in future studies. Rats accumulated discrete numbers of flashes presented to the left and right visual hemifields and indicated the side that had the greater number of flashes. Using a signal-detection theory-based model we found that the standard deviation in their internal estimate of flash number scaled linearly with the number of flashes. This indicates a major source of noise that surprisingly is not consistent with the widely used 'drift-diffusion modeling' (DDM) approach but is  instead closely related to proposed models of numerical cognition and counting. We speculate that this form of noise could be important in accumulation of evidence tasks generally.,10.7554/elife.11308
0,Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that provide hearing to deaf patients although outcomes are highly variable even with prolonged training and  use. The central auditory system must process cochlear implant signals but it is unclear how neural circuits adapt-or fail to adapt-to such inputs. The knowledge  of these mechanisms is required for development of next-generation neuroprosthetics that interface with existing neural circuits and enable synaptic plasticity to improve perceptual outcomes. Here we describe a new system for cochlear implant insertion stimulation and behavioral training in rats. Animals were first ensured to have significant hearing loss via physiological and behavioral criteria. We developed a surgical approach for multichannel (2- or 8-channel) array insertion comparable with implantation procedures and depth in  humans. Peripheral and cortical responses to stimulation were used to program the implant objectively. Animals fitted with implants learned to use them for an auditory-dependent task that assesses frequency detection and recognition in a background of environmentally and self-generated noise and ceased responding appropriately to sounds when the implant was temporarily inactivated. This physiologically calibrated and behaviorally validated system provides a powerful  opportunity to study the neural basis of neuroprosthetic device use and plasticity.,10.1152/jn.00048.2016
0,Estrogen and androgen are synthesized from cholesterol locally in hippocampal neurons of adult animals. These neurosteroids are synthesized by cytochrome P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) and 5alpha-reductase. The expression levels of enzymes are as low as 1/200-1/50000 of those in endocrine organs however these numbers are high enough for local synthesis. Localization of P450(17alpha) P450arom 17beta-HSD and 5alpha-reductase is observed in principal glutamatergic neurons in CA1 CA3 and the dendate gyrus. Several nanomolar levels of estrogen and androgen are observed in the hippocampus. Estrogen modulates memory-related synaptic plasticity not only slowly but also rapidly in the hippocampus. Rapid action of 17beta-estradiol via membrane receptors is demonstrated for spinogenesis and long-term depression (LTD). The enhancement of  LTD by 1-10nM estradiol occurs within 1 h. The density of spine is increased in CA1 pyramidal neurons within 2h after application of estradiol. The density of spine-like structure is however decreased by estradiol in CA3 pyramidal neurons. ERalpha but not ERbeta induces the same enhancement/suppression effects on both spinogenesis and LTD.,10.1016/j.mce.2008.04.017

0,In this article the authors consider optimal decision making in two-alternative  forced-choice (TAFC) tasks. They begin by analyzing 6 models of TAFC decision making and show that all but one can be reduced to the drift diffusion model implementing the statistically optimal algorithm (most accurate for a given speed or fastest for a given accuracy). They prove further that there is always an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy that maximizes various reward functions including reward rate (percentage of correct responses per unit time) as well as several other objective functions including ones weighted for accuracy. They use these findings to address empirical data and make novel predictions about performance under optimality.,10.1037/0033-295x.113.4.700

0,Gradual accumulation of evidence is thought to be fundamental for decision-making and its neural correlates have been found in several brain regions. Here we develop a generalizable method to measure tuning curves that specify the relationship between neural responses and mentally accumulated evidence and apply it to distinguish the encoding of decision variables in posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields FOF).  We recorded the firing rates of neurons in posterior parietal cortex and FOF from rats performing a perceptual decision-making task. Classical analyses uncovered correlates of accumulating evidence similar to previous observations in primates and also similar across the two regions. However tuning curve assays revealed that while the posterior parietal cortex encodes a graded value of the accumulating evidence the FOF has a more categorical encoding that indicates throughout the trial the decision provisionally favoured by the evidence accumulated so far. Contrary to current views this suggests that premotor activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the accumulation process  but instead has a more categorical function such as transforming accumulated evidence into a discrete choice. To probe causally the role of FOF activity we optogenetically silenced it during different time points of the trial. Consistent with a role in committing to a categorical choice at the end of the evidence accumulation process but not consistent with a role during the accumulation itself a behavioural effect was observed only when FOF silencing occurred at the end of the perceptual stimulus. Our results place important constraints on the circuit logic of brain regions involved in decision-making.,10.1038/nature14066
0,Interactions between the hippocampus and the cortex are critical for memory. Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) identify epileptic brain regions and can impair memory but the mechanisms by which they interact with physiological patterns of network activity are mostly undefined. We show in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy that spontaneous hippocampal IEDs correlate with impaired  memory consolidation and that they are precisely coordinated with spindle oscillations in the prefrontal cortex during nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep.  This coordination surpasses the normal physiological ripple-spindle coupling and  is accompanied by decreased ripple occurrence. IEDs also induce spindles during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness-behavioral states that do not naturally express these oscillations-by generating a cortical 'down' state. In a  pilot clinical examination of four subjects with focal epilepsy we confirm a similar correlation of temporofrontal IEDs with spindles over anatomically restricted cortical regions. These findings imply that IEDs may impair memory via the misappropriation of physiological mechanisms for hippocampal-cortical coupling which suggests a target for the treatment of memory impairment in epilepsy.,10.1038/nm.4084
0,Many animal species rely on chemical signals to extract ecologically important information from the environment. Yet in natural conditions chemical signals will frequently undergo concentration changes that produce differences in both level and pattern of activation of olfactory receptor neurons. Thus a central problem  in olfactory processing is how the system is able to recognize the same stimulus  across different concentrations. To signal species identity for mate recognition some insects use the ratio of two components in a binary chemical mixture to produce a code that is invariant to dilution. Here using psychophysical methods we show that rats also classify binary odor mixtures according to the molar ratios of their components spontaneously generalizing over at least a tenfold concentration range. These results indicate that extracting chemical ratio information is not restricted to pheromone signaling and suggest a general solution for concentration-invariant odor recognition by the mammalian olfactory  system.,10.3389/neuro.06.003.2007
0,Mitral and tufted cells (MTCs) of the mammalian olfactory bulb are connected via  dendrodendritic synapses with inhibitory interneurons in the external plexiform layer. The range spatial layout and temporal properties of inhibitory interactions between MTCs mediated by inhibitory interneurons remain unclear. Therefore we tested for inhibitory interactions using an optogenetic approach. We optically stimulated MTCs expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in transgenic mice while recording from individual MTCs in juxtacellular or whole-cell configuration in vivo. We used a spatial noise stimulus for mapping interactions between MTCs belonging to different glomeruli in the dorsal bulb. Analyzing firing responses of MTCs to the stimulus we did not find robust lateral inhibitory effects that were spatially specific. However analysis of sub-threshold changes in the membrane potential revealed evidence for inhibitory interactions between MTCs that belong to different glomerular units. These lateral inhibitory effects were  short-lived and spatially specific. MTC response maps showed hyperpolarizing effects radially extending over more than five glomerular diameters. The inhibitory maps exhibited non-symmetrical yet distance-dependent characteristics.,10.3389/fncir.2016.00015
0,We experimentally demonstrate the focusing of surface plasmon polaritons by a plasmonic lens illuminated with radially polarized light. The field distribution  is characterized by near-field scanning optical microscope. A sharp focal spot corresponding to a zero-order Bessel function is observed. For comparison the plasmonic lens is also measured with linearly polarized light illumination resulting in two separated lobes. Finally we verify that the focal spot maintains its width along the optical axis of the plasmonic lens. The results demonstrate the advantage of using radially polarized light for nanofocusing applications involving surface plasmon polaritons.,10.1021/nl900694r
0,We often assume that the variables of functional and structural brain parameters  - such as synaptic weights the firing rates of individual neurons the synchronous discharge of neural populations the number of synaptic contacts between neurons and the size of dendritic boutons - have a bell-shaped distribution. However at many physiological and anatomical levels in the brain  the distribution of numerous parameters is in fact strongly skewed with a heavy tail suggesting that skewed (typically lognormal) distributions are fundamental  to structural and functional brain organization. This insight not only has implications for how we should collect and analyse data it may also help us to understand how the different levels of skewed distributions - from synapses to cognition - are related to each other.,10.1038/nrn3687
0,A computational model is described in which the sizes of variables are represented by the explicit times at which action potentials occur rather than by the more usual 'firing rate' of neurons. The comparison of patterns over sets  of analogue variables is done by a network using different delays for different information paths. This mode of computation explains how one scheme of neuroarchitecture can be used for very different sensory modalities and seemingly different computations. The oscillations and anatomy of the mammalian olfactory systems have a simple interpretation in terms of this representation and relate  to processing in the auditory system. Single-electrode recording would not detect such neural computing. Recognition 'units' in this style respond more like radial basis function units than elementary sigmoid units.,10.1038/376033a0
0,Flexible navigation demands knowledge of boundaries routes and their relationships. Within a multi-path environment a subpopulation of subiculum neurons robustly encoded the axis of travel. The firing of axis-tuned neurons peaked bimodally at head orientations 180° apart. Environmental manipulations showed these neurons to be anchored to environmental boundaries but to lack axis  tuning in an open arena. Axis-tuned neurons thus provide a powerful mechanism for mapping relationships between routes and the larger environmental context.,10.1038/nn.4464
0,Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have spatial firing fields that repeat periodically in a hexagonal pattern. When animals move activity is translated between grid cells in accordance with the animal's displacement in the environment. For this translation to occur grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed  is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit such as grid head-direction and border cells. These 'speed cells' are characterized by a context-invariant positive linear response to running speed and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50-80 ms. Our observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex.,10.1038/nature14622
0,The ability to find one's way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place distance and direction but the implementation of these  operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood. Here we show that the  dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a directionally oriented topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment. Its key unit is  the 'grid cell' which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing  but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks but persists in their absence suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.,10.1038/nature03721
0,Hippocampal information processing is discretized by oscillations and the ensemble activity of place cells is organized into temporal sequences bounded by  theta cycles. Theta sequences represent time-compressed trajectories through space. Their forward-directed nature makes them an intuitive candidate mechanism  for planning future trajectories but their connection to goal-directed behavior  remains unclear. As rats performed a value-guided decision-making task the extent to which theta sequences projected ahead of the animal's current location  varied on a moment-by-moment basis depending on the rat's goals. Look-ahead extended farther on journeys to distant goals than on journeys to more proximal goals and was predictive of the animal's destination. On arrival at goals however look-ahead was similar regardless of where the animal began its journey  from. Together these results provide evidence that hippocampal theta sequences contain information related to goals or intentions pointing toward a potential spatial basis for planning.,10.1038/nn.3909
0,Different olfactory cortical regions are thought to harbor distinct sensory representations enabling each area to play a unique role in odor perception and  behavior. In the piriform cortex (PCx) spatially dispersed sensory inputs evoke  activity in distributed ensembles of neurons that act as substrates for odor learning. In contrast the posterolateral cortical amygdala (plCoA) receives hardwired inputs that may link specific odor cues to innate olfactory behaviors.  Here we show that despite stark differences in the patterning of plCoA and PCx inputs odor-evoked neural ensembles in both areas are equally capable of discriminating odors and exhibit similar odor tuning reliability and correlation structure. These results demonstrate that brain regions mediating odor-driven innate behaviors can like brain areas involved in odor learning represent odor objects using distributive population codes; these findings suggest both alternative mechanisms for the generation of innate odor-driven behaviors and additional roles for the plCoA in odor perception.,10.1016/j.neuron.2017.02.010
0,Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast the hippocampal electroencephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7-12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field the complex  spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the  same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100 degrees to 355 degrees in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior such as the time after place field  entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under  which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.,10.1002/hipo.450030307
0,For reliable stimulus identification sensory codes have to be robust by including redundancy to combat noise but redundancy sacrifices coding efficiency. To address how experience affects the balance between the robustness  and efficiency of sensory codes we probed odor representations in the mouse olfactory bulb during learning over a week using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging. When mice learned to discriminate between two dissimilar odorants responses of mitral cell ensembles to the two odorants gradually became less discrete increasing the efficiency. In contrast when mice learned to discriminate between two very similar odorants the initially overlapping representations of the two odorants became progressively decorrelated enhancing  the robustness. Qualitatively similar changes were observed when the same odorants were experienced passively a condition that would induce implicit perceptual learning. These results suggest that experience adjusts odor representations to balance the robustness and efficiency depending on the similarity of the experienced odorants.,10.1016/j.neuron.2016.09.004
0,The motivation to seek social contact may arise from either positive or negative  emotional states as social interaction can be rewarding and social isolation can be aversive. While ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons may mediate social reward a cellular substrate for the negative affective state of loneliness has remained elusive. Here we identify a functional role for DA neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in which we observe synaptic changes following acute social isolation. DRN DA neurons show increased activity upon social contact following isolation revealed by in vivo calcium imaging. Optogenetic activation of DRN DA neurons increases social preference but causes place avoidance. Furthermore these neurons are necessary for promoting rebound sociability following an acute period of isolation. Finally the degree to which  these neurons modulate behavior is predicted by social rank together supporting  a role for DRN dopamine neurons in mediating a loneliness-like state.

0,Cognitive inhibitory control the ability to rapidly suppress responses inappropriate for the context is essential for flexible and adaptive behavior. Although most studies on inhibitory control have focused on the fronto-basal-ganglia circuit we found that rapid behavioral stopping is enabled  by neuronal inhibition in the basal forebrain (BF). In rats performing the stop signal task putative noncholinergic BF neurons with phasic bursting responses to the go signal were nearly completely inhibited by the stop signal. The onset of BF neuronal inhibition was tightly coupled with and temporally preceded the latency to stop the stop signal reaction time. Artificial inhibition of BF activity in the absence of the stop signal was sufficient to reproduce rapid behavioral stopping. These results reveal a previously unknown subcortical mechanism of rapid inhibitory control by the BF which provides bidirectional control over the speed of response generation and inhibition.,10.1038/nn.4110
0,Most glial cells show pronounced migratory abilities and generally follow axonal  trajectories to reach their final destination. However the molecular cues controlling their directional migration are largely unknown. To address this we  established glial migration onto the developing Drosophila leg imaginal disc as a model. Here CNS-derived glial cells move along nerves containing motoaxons and sensory axons. Along their path glial cells encounter at least three choice points where directional decisions are needed. Subsequent genetic analyses allowed uncovering mechanisms that escaped previous studies. Most strikingly we  found that glial cells require the expression of the repulsive guidance receptors PlexinA/B and Robo2 to prevent breaking away from the nerve. Interestingly the repulsive ligands are presented by the underlying leg imaginal disc epithelium which appears to push glial cells toward the axon fascicle. In conclusion nerve  formation not only requires neuron-glia interaction but also depends on glial-epithelial communication.,10.1016/j.devcel.2016.11.016

0,Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A fundamental issue is whether and how this capability is used in information processing. According to the 'cell assembly' hypothesis transient synchrony of anatomically  distributed groups of neurons underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly neuron populations should be arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation  by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30 ms suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time window for synaptic plasticity we propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.,10.1038/nature01834
0,There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited and that producing large multimodal and complex datasets will with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms lead to fundamental insights into the way the  brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist and if they did we  would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are  among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels from the overall logical flow via logical gates to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy  of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems regardless of the amount of data. Additionally we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268
0,How long does it take for the human visual system to process a complex natural image? Subjectively recognition of familiar objects and scenes appears to be virtually instantaneous but measuring this processing time experimentally has proved difficult. Behavioural measures such as reaction times can be used but these include not only visual processing but also the time required for response  execution. However event-related potentials (ERPs) can sometimes reveal signs of neural processing well before the motor output. Here we use a go/no-go categorization task in which subjects have to decide whether a previously unseen  photograph flashed on for just 20 ms contains an animal. ERP analysis revealed  a frontal negativity specific to no-go trials that develops roughly 150 ms after  stimulus onset. We conclude that the visual processing needed to perform this highly demanding task can be achieved in under 150 ms.,10.1038/381520a0
0,In the vast majority of brain areas the firing rates of neurons averaged over several hundred milliseconds to several seconds can be strongly modulated by and provide accurate information about properties of their inputs. This is referred to as the rate code. However the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise timing of spikes over short timescales (<10 ms). Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory  inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus oscillations  and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal sequence learning.,10.1038/nature00807
0,When spinal circuits generate rhythmic movements it is important that the neuronal activity remains within stable bounds to avoid saturation and to preserve responsiveness. Here we simultaneously record from hundreds of neurons  in lumbar spinal circuits of turtles and establish the neuronal fraction that operates within either a 'mean-driven' or a 'fluctuation-driven' regime. Fluctuation-driven neurons have a 'supralinear' input-output curve which enhances sensitivity whereas the mean-driven regime reduces sensitivity. We find a rich diversity of firing rates across the neuronal population as reflected in a lognormal distribution and demonstrate that half of the neurons spend at least 50 % of the time in the 'fluctuation-driven' regime regardless of behavior. Because  of the disparity in input-output properties for these two regimes this fraction  may reflect a fine trade-off between stability and sensitivity in order to maintain flexibility across behaviors.,10.7554/elife.18805
0,The basal ganglia have been shown to contribute to habit and stimulus-response (S-R) learning. These forms of learning have the property of slow acquisition and in humans can occur without conscious awareness. This paper proposes that one aspect of basal ganglia-based learning is the recoding of cortically derived  information within the striatum. Modular corticostriatal projection patterns demonstrated experimentally are viewed as producing recoded templates suitable for the gradual selection of new input-output relations in cortico-basal ganglia  loops. Recordings from striatal projection neurons and interneurons show that activity patterns in the striatum are modified gradually during the course of S-R learning. It is proposed that this recoding within the striatum can chunk the representations of motor and cognitive action sequences so that they can be implemented as performance units. This scheme generalizes Miller's notion of information chunking to action control. The formation and the efficient implementation of action chunks are viewed as being based on predictive signals.  It is suggested that information chunking provides a mechanism for the acquisition and the expression of action repertoires that without such information compression would be biologically unwieldy or difficult to implement. The learning and memory functions of the basal ganglia are thus seen as core features of the basal ganglia's influence on motor and cognitive pattern generators.,10.1006/nlme.1998.3843
0,How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses distractors is unknown. Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to control sensory selection. To test this idea and more  generally dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection we developed a cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally precise window the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN  activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection in which the PFC biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain selecting appropriate inputs for further processing.,10.1038/nature15398
0,Cortical activity involves large populations of neurons even when it is limited  to functionally coherent areas. Electrophysiological recordings on the other hand involve comparatively small neural ensembles even when modern-day techniques are used. Here we review results which have started to fill the gap between these two scales of inquiry by shedding light on the statistical distributions of activity in large populations of cells. We put our main focus on data recorded in awake animals that perform simple decision-making tasks and consider statistical distributions of activity throughout cortex across sensory associative and motor areas. We transversally review the complexity of these distributions from distributions of firing rates and metrics of spike-train structure through distributions of tuning to stimuli or actions and of choice signals and finally the dynamical evolution of neural population activity and the distributions of (pairwise) neural interactions. This approach reveals shared patterns of statistical organization across cortex including: (i) long-tailed distributions of activity where quasi-silence seems to be the rule for a majority of neurons; that are barely distinguishable between spontaneous and active states; (ii) distributions of tuning parameters for sensory (and motor) variables which show an extensive extrapolation and fragmentation of their representations in the periphery; and (iii) population-wide dynamics that reveal  rotations of internal representations over time whose traces can be found both in stimulus-driven and internally generated activity. We discuss how these insights are leading us away from the notion of discrete classes of cells and are acting as powerful constraints on theories and models of cortical organization and population coding.,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.09.004
0,Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is important for memory consolidation. During sleep neural patterns reflecting previously acquired information are replayed. One possible reason for this is that such replay exchanges information between hippocampus and neocortex supporting consolidation. We recorded neuron ensembles in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to study memory trace reactivation during SWS following learning and execution of cross-modal strategy shifts. In general reactivation of learning-related patterns occurred in distinct highly synchronized transient bouts mostly simultaneous with hippocampal sharp wave/ripple complexes (SPWRs) when hippocampal ensemble reactivation and cortico-hippocampal interaction is enhanced. During sleep following learning of a new rule mPFC neural patterns that appeared during response selection replayed prominently coincident with hippocampal SPWRs. This was learning dependent as the patterns appeared only after rule acquisition. Therefore learning or the resulting reliable reward influenced which patterns were most strongly encoded and successively reactivated in the hippocampal/prefrontal network.,10.1038/nn.2337

0,Intelligent behavior demands not only multiple forms of spatial representation but also coordination among the brain regions mediating those representations. Retrosplenial cortex is densely interconnected with the majority of cortical and  subcortical brain structures that register an animal's position in multiple internal and external spatial frames of reference. This unique anatomy suggests that it functions to integrate distinct forms of spatial information and provides an interface for transformations between them. Evidence for this was found in rats traversing two different routes placed at different environmental locations. Retrosplenial ensembles robustly encoded conjunctions of progress through the current route position in the larger environment and the left versus right turning behavior of the animal. Thus the retrosplenial cortex has the requisite  dynamics to serve as an intermediary between brain regions generating different forms of spatial mapping a result that is consistent with navigational and episodic memory impairments following damage to this region in humans.,10.1038/nn.4058
0,Theoretical models have long pointed to the dentate gyrus as a possible source of neuronal pattern separation. In agreement with predictions from these models we  show that minimal changes in the shape of the environment in which rats are exploring can substantially alter correlated activity patterns among place-modulated granule cells in the dentate gyrus. When the environments are made more different new cell populations are recruited in CA3 but not in the dentate gyrus. These results imply a dual mechanism for pattern separation in which signals from the entorhinal cortex can be decorrelated both by changes in coincidence patterns in the dentate gyrus and by recruitment of nonoverlapping cell assemblies in CA3.,10.1126/science.1135801
0,Episodic memories initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However the engrams and circuits that support neocortical memory consolidation have thus far been unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells which are critical for remote contextual fear memory were rapidly generated during initial learning through inputs from both the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. After their generation the prefrontal engram cells with support from  hippocampal memory engram cells became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time engram cells in the basolateral amygdala which were necessary for fear memory were maintained. Our  data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.,10.1126/science.aam6808

0,The nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system is sexually dimorphic. In female but not male rats striatal DA activity is modulated by gonadal steroid hormones. Ovariectomy (OVX) decreases striatal DA release and turnover. Estrogen replacement restores the response to that of the intact female in estrus. In contrast castration (CAST) of male rats has no effect on the stimulated release  of DA from striatal tissue. This report addresses the question: Does estrogen act directly on the striatum to induce changes in DA release? Physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and other steroids or a nonsteroidal estrogen analog were applied directly to striatal tissue maintained in an in vitro superfusion system. The effect of hormonal treatments on the responsiveness of striatal DA terminals to stimulation was examined in tissue from OVX females and  intact and CAST male rats. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Infusion of 17 beta-estradiol (p less than 0.01) and diethylstilbestrol (p less than 0.05) increased amphetamine (AMPH)-stimulated striatal DA release from striatal tissue  of OVX female rats compared with the effect of cholesterol. 17 alpha-Estradiol also tended to potentiate the striatal DA response to AMPH but this result was not statistically significant (p less than 0.062). 17 beta-Estradiol had no effect on AMPH-stimulated DA release from striatal tissue of intact male rats. (2) The KCl-stimulated release of DA from striatal tissue of OVX rats exposed in  vitro to 100 pg/ml 17 beta-estradiol (a physiological dose) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than the response after exposure to vehicle.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),10.1002/syn.890050211

0,Estradiol was previously reported to increase striatal D(2) receptor density. The following experiments investigated the contribution of each estrogen receptor in  estradiol modulation of D(2) receptors. Ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 2 weeks with an agonist for ERalpha 44'4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-135-triyl)trisphenol (PPT) an agonist for ERbeta 23-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and compared to estradiol treatment. Ovariectomy decreased D(2) agonist and antagonist striatal binding sites specific binding was measured using [(3)H]quinpirole and [(3)H]spiperone.  Estradiol prevented this decrease while DPN but not PPT mimicked the estradiol increase of D(2) receptor specific binding. In the nucleus accumbens ovariectomy decreased [(3)H]quinpirole specific binding in the core and left the shell unchanged. Similarly estradiol and DPN but not PPT prevented this decrease. Neither ovariectomy nor treatments affected [(3)H]spiperone specific binding in this area. In the olfactory tubercle neither ovariectomy nor treatments changed  D(2) receptor binding. Finally both ovariectomy and treatments did not affect D(2L) D(2S) mRNA and D(2L)/D(2S) ratios measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The present results show for the first time that an ERbeta agonist treatment modulates D(2) receptors and suggest that ERbeta is involved in the estradiol modulation of D(2) receptors.,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.10.004
0,The cortical microcircuit is built with recurrent excitatory connections and it  has long been suggested that the purpose of this design is to enable intrinsically driven reverberating activity. To understand the dynamics of neocortical intrinsic activity better we performed two-photon calcium imaging of populations of neurons from the primary visual cortex of awake mice during visual stimulation and spontaneous activity. In both conditions cortical activity is dominated by coactive groups of neurons forming ensembles whose activation cannot be explained by the independent firing properties of their contributing neurons considered in isolation. Moreover individual neurons flexibly join multiple ensembles vastly expanding the encoding potential of the circuit. Intriguingly the same coactive ensembles can repeat spontaneously and in response to visual stimuli indicating that stimulus-evoked responses arise from  activating these intrinsic building blocks. Although the spatial properties of stimulus-driven and spontaneous ensembles are similar spontaneous ensembles are  active at random intervals whereas visually evoked ensembles are time-locked to  stimuli. We conclude that neuronal ensembles built by the coactivation of flexible groups of neurons are emergent functional units of cortical activity and propose that visual stimuli recruit intrinsically generated ensembles to represent visual attributes.,10.1073/pnas.1406077111
0,Thinking allows an animal to take an effective action in a novel situation based  on a mental exploration of possibilities and previous knowledge. We describe a model animal with a neural system based loosely on the rodent hippocampus which performs mental exploration to find a useful route in a spatial world it has previously learned. It then mentally recapitulates the chosen route and this intent is converted to motor acts that move the animal physically along the route. The modeling is based on spiking neurons with spike-frequency adaptation.  Adaptation causes the continuing evolution in the pattern of neural activity that is essential to mental exploration. A successful mental exploration is remembered through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. The system is also an episodic memory for an animal chiefly concerned with locations.,10.1073/pnas.0913991107

0,The progressive escalation of psychomotor responses that results from repeated cocaine administration is termed sensitization. This phenomenon alters the intrinsic properties of dopamine (DA) neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) leading to enhanced dopaminergic transmission in the mesocorticolimbic network. The mechanisms underlying this augmented excitation are nonetheless poorly understood. DA neurons display the hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation current dubbed Ih We recently demonstrated that Ih and membrane capacitance are substantially reduced in VTA DA cells from cocaine-sensitized rats. The present study shows that 7 days of cocaine withdrawal did not normalize Ih and capacitance. In cells from cocaine-sensitized animals the amplitude of excitatory synaptic potentials at -70 mV was ∼39% larger in contrast to controls. Raise and decay phases of the synaptic signal were faster under cocaine a result associated with a reduced membrane time constant. Synaptic summation was paradoxically elevated by cocaine exposure as it consisted of a significantly reduced summation indexed but a considerably increased depolarization. These effects are at least a consequence of the reduced capacitance. Ih attenuation is unlikely to explain such observations since at -70 mV no statistical differences exist in Ih or input resistance. The neuronal  shrinkage associated with a diminished capacitance may help to understand two fundamental elements of drug addiction: incentive sensitization and negative emotional states. A reduced cell size may lead to substantial enhancement of cue-triggered bursting which underlies drug craving and reward anticipation whereas it could also result in DA depletion as smaller neurons might express low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase.NEW & NOTEWORTHY: This work uses a new approach that directly extracts important biophysical parameters from alpha function-evoked synaptic potentials. Two of these parameters are the cell membrane capacitance (Cm) and rate at any time point of the synaptic waveform. The use of such methodology shows that cocaine sensitization reduces Cm and increases the speed of synaptic signaling. Paradoxically although synaptic potentials show a faster decay under cocaine their temporal summation is substantially elevated.,10.1152/jn.00465.2016
0,Many animals navigate using a combination of visual landmarks and path integration. In mammalian brains head direction cells integrate these two streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body a toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through  persistent activity a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors network structures that have been proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits.,10.1038/nature14446
0,Analogous to learning and memory storage long-term potentiation (LTP) is divided into induction and maintenance phases. Testing the hypothesis that the mechanism  of LTP maintenance stores information requires reversing this mechanism in vivo and finding out whether long-term stored information is lost. This was not previously possible. Recently however persistent phosphorylation by the atypical protein kinase C isoform protein kinase Mzeta (PKMz) has been found to maintain late LTP in hippocampal slices. Here we show that a cell-permeable PKMz inhibitor injected in the rat hippocampus both reverses LTP maintenance in vivo and produces persistent loss of 1-day-old spatial information. Thus the mechanism maintaining LTP sustains spatial memory.,10.1126/science.1128657
0,The ventral hippocampus unlike its dorsal counterpart is required for anxiety-like behavior. The means by which it acts are unknown. We hypothesized that the hippocampus synchronizes with downstream targets that influence anxiety such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis we recorded mPFC and hippocampal activity in mice exposed to two anxiogenic arenas. Theta-frequency activity in the mPFC and ventral but not dorsal hippocampus was highly correlated at baseline and this correlation increased in both anxiogenic  environments. Increases in mPFC theta power predicted avoidance of the aversive compartments of each arena and were larger in serotonin 1A receptor knockout mice a genetic model of increased anxiety-like behavior. These results suggest a role for theta-frequency synchronization between the ventral hippocampus and the  mPFC in anxiety. They are consistent with the notion that such synchronization is a general mechanism by which the hippocampus communicates with downstream structures of behavioral relevance.,10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.002
0,The need to sleep grows with the duration of wakefulness and dissipates with time spent asleep a process called sleep homeostasis. What are the consequences of staying awake on brain cells and why is sleep needed? Surprisingly we do not know whether the firing of cortical neurons is affected by how long an animal has been awake or asleep. Here we found that after sustained wakefulness cortical neurons fire at higher frequencies in all behavioral states. During early NREM sleep after sustained wakefulness periods of population activity (ON) are short frequent and associated with synchronous firing while periods of neuronal silence are long and frequent. After sustained sleep firing rates and synchrony  decrease while the duration of ON periods increases. Changes in firing patterns  in NREM sleep correlate with changes in slow-wave activity a marker of sleep homeostasis. Thus the systematic increase of firing during wakefulness is counterbalanced by staying asleep.,10.1016/j.neuron.2009.08.024
0,Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients do not make the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The absence of FMRP causes dysregulated translation abnormal synaptic plasticity and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. But FMRP loss has minimal effects on memory itself making it difficult to understand why the absence of FMRP impairs memory discrimination and increases risk of autistic symptoms in patients such as exaggerated responses to environmental changes. While Fmr1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice perform cognitive discrimination tasks we find abnormal patterns of coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in perisomatic and dendritic hippocampal CA1 local field potentials of the KO. Perisomatic CA1 theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling  (PAC) decreases with familiarity in both the WT and KO but activating an invisible shock zone subsequently changing its location or turning it off changes the pattern of oscillatory events in the LFPs recorded along the somato-dendritic axis of CA1. The cognition-dependent changes of this pattern of  neural activity are relatively constrained in WT mice compared to KO mice which  exhibit abnormally weak changes during the cognitive challenge caused by changing the location of the shock zone and exaggerated patterns of change when the shock  zone is turned off. Such pathophysiology might explain how dysregulated translation leads to intellectual disability in FXS. These findings demonstrate major functional abnormalities after the loss of FMRP in the dynamics of neural oscillations and that these impairments would be difficult to detect by steady-state measurements with the subject at rest or in steady conditions.,10.1016/j.nbd.2016.01.003
0,During spatial navigation neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location head direction speed and proximity to boundaries. These activity patterns are thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this  representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit such  as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal-entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.,10.1038/nature21692
0,Recent work has shown that thalamocortical (TC) inputs can be plastic after the developmental critical period has closed but the mechanism that enables re-establishment of plasticity is unclear. Here we find that long-term potentiation (LTP) at TC inputs is transiently restored in spared barrel cortex following either a unilateral infra-orbital nerve (ION) lesion unilateral whisker trimming or unilateral ablation of the rodent barrel cortex. Restoration of LTP is associated with increased potency at TC input and reactivates anatomical map plasticity induced by whisker follicle ablation. The reactivation  of TC LTP is accompanied by reappearance of silent synapses. Both LTP and silent  synapse formation are preceded by transient re-expression of synaptic GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors which are required for the reappearance of TC plasticity. These results clearly demonstrate that peripheral sensory deprivation reactivates synaptic plasticity in the mature layer 4 barrel cortex with features similar to the developmental critical period.,10.1016/j.celrep.2017.06.018
0,Neural computation is inescapably closed-loop: the nervous system processes sensory signals to shape motor output and motor output consequently shapes sensory input. Technological advances have enabled neuroscientists to close open and alter feedback loops in a wide range of experimental preparations. The  experimental capability of manipulating the topology-that is how information can flow between subsystems-provides new opportunities to understand the mechanisms and computations underlying behavior. These experiments encompass a spectrum of approaches from fully open-loop restrained preparations to the fully closed-loop character of free behavior. Control theory and system identification provide a clear computational framework for relating these experimental approaches. We describe recent progress and new directions for translating experiments at one level in this spectrum to predictions at another level. Operating across this spectrum can reveal new understanding of how low-level neural mechanisms relate to high-level function during closed-loop behavior.,10.1016/j.conb.2013.11.005
0,During much of sleep cortical neurons undergo near-synchronous slow oscillation  cycles in membrane potential which give rise to the largest spontaneous waves observed in the normal electroencephalogram (EEG). Slow oscillations underlie characteristic features of the sleep EEG such as slow waves and spindles. Here we show that in sleeping subjects slow waves and spindles can be triggered noninvasively and reliably by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). With appropriate stimulation parameters each TMS pulse at <1 Hz evokes an individual high-amplitude slow wave that originates under the coil and spreads over the cortex. TMS triggering of slow waves reveals intrinsic bistability in thalamocortical networks during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Moreover evoked slow waves lead to a deepening of sleep and to an increase in EEG slow-wave activity (0.5-4.5 Hz) which is thought to play a role in brain restoration and memory consolidation.,10.1073/pnas.0702495104
0,A long-standing conjecture in neuroscience is that aspects of cognition depend on the brain's ability to self-generate sequential neuronal activity. We found that  reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences thereby predicting behavioral choices including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks. We hypothesize that neuronal representations evolved for encoding distance in spatial navigation also support episodic recall and the planning of action sequences.,10.1126/science.1159775

0,Sex pheromones have been shown to constitute a crucial aspect of salamander reproduction. Until now courtship pheromones of Salamandridae and Plethodontidae have been intensively studied but information on chemical communication in other urodelan families is essentially lacking. The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum Ambystomatidae) has a courtship display that suggests a key role for chemical communication in the orchestration of its sexual behavior but no sex pheromones  have yet been characterized from this species. Here we combined whole transcriptome analyses of the male cloaca with proteomic analyses of water in which axolotls were allowed to court to show that male axolotls secrete multiple  ca. 20 kDa glycosylated sodefrin precursor-like factor (SPF) proteins during courtship. In combination with phylogenetic analyses our data show that the male cloaca essentially secretes a courtship-specific clade of SPF proteins that is orthologous to salamandrid courtship pheromones. In addition we identified an SPF protein for which no orthologs have been described from other salamanders so  far. Overall our study advocates a central role for SPF proteins during the courtship display of axolotls and adds knowledge on pheromone use in a previously unexplored deep evolutionary branch of salamander evolution.,10.1038/srep20184

0,The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for controlling motivated behaviours across mammalian species. In addition to intra-cortical connectivity  prefrontal projection neurons innervate subcortical structures that contribute to reward-seeking behaviours such as the ventral striatum and midline thalamus. While connectivity among these structures contributes to appetitive behaviours how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode reward-relevant information to  guide reward seeking is unknown. Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons in mice during an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level these neurons display diverse activity patterns during the presentation of reward-predictive cues. However recordings from prefrontal neurons with resolved projection targets reveal that individual corticostriatal neurons show response tuning to reward-predictive cues such that excitatory cue responses are amplified across learning. By contrast corticothalamic neurons gradually develop new primarily inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across learning. Furthermore bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of these neurons reveals that stimulation  of corticostriatal neurons promotes conditioned reward-seeking behaviour after learning while activity in corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the acquisition and expression of conditioned reward seeking. These data show how prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-seeking behaviour through the opposing activities of projection-specific cell populations.,10.1038/nature21376
0,Control theory arose from a need to control synthetic systems. From regulating steam engines to tuning radios to devices capable of autonomous movement it provided a formal mathematical basis for understanding the role of feedback in the stability (or change) of dynamical systems. It provides a framework for understanding any system with regulation via feedback including biological ones  such as regulatory gene networks cellular metabolic systems sensorimotor dynamics of moving animals and even ecological or evolutionary dynamics of organisms and populations. Here we focus on four case studies of the sensorimotor dynamics of animals each of which involves the application of principles from control theory to probe stability and feedback in an organism's response to perturbations. We use examples from aquatic (two behaviors performed  by electric fish) terrestrial (following of walls by cockroaches) and aerial environments (flight control by moths) to highlight how one can use control theory to understand the way feedback mechanisms interact with the physical dynamics of animals to determine their stability and response to sensory inputs and perturbations. Each case study is cast as a control problem with sensory input neural processing and motor dynamics the output of which feeds back to the sensory inputs. Collectively the interaction of these systems in a closed loop determines the behavior of the entire system.,10.1093/icb/icu050

0,A fundamental task in neuroscience is to understand how neural ensembles represent information. Population decoding is a useful tool to extract information from neuronal populations based on the ensemble spiking activity. We  propose a novel Bayesian decoding paradigm to decode unsorted spikes in the rat hippocampus. Our approach uses a direct mapping between spike waveform features and covariates of interest and avoids accumulation of spike sorting errors. Our decoding paradigm is nonparametric encoding model-free for representing stimuli and extracts information from all available spikes and their waveform features. We apply the proposed Bayesian decoding algorithm to a position reconstruction task for freely behaving rats based on tetrode recordings of rat hippocampal neuronal activity. Our detailed decoding analyses demonstrate that our approach is efficient and better utilizes the available information in the nonsortable hash than the standard sorting-based decoding algorithm. Our approach can be adapted to an online encoding/decoding framework for applications that require real-time decoding such as brain-machine interfaces.,10.1152/jn.01046.2012

0,Understanding how the brain processes sensory input to generate behavior remains  an important problem in neuroscience. Towards this end it is useful to compare results obtained across multiple species to gain understanding as to the general  principles of neural coding. Here we investigated hindbrain pyramidal cell activity in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus albifrons We found strong heterogeneities when looking at baseline activity. Additionally ON- and OFF-type cells responded to increases and decreases of sinusoidal and noise stimuli respectively. While both cell types displayed band-pass tuning OFF-type cells were more broadly tuned than their ON-type counterparts. The observed heterogeneities in baseline activity as well as the greater broadband tuning of OFF-type cells were both similar to those previously reported in other weakly electric fish species suggesting that they constitute general features of sensory processing. However we found that peak tuning occurred at frequencies ∼15 Hz in A. albifrons which is much lower than values reported in the closely related species Apteronotus leptorhynchus and the more distantly related species  Eigenmannia virescens In response to stimuli with time-varying amplitude (i.e. envelope) ON- and OFF-type cells displayed similar high-pass tuning curves characteristic of fractional differentiation and possibly indicate optimized coding. These tuning curves were qualitatively similar to those of pyramidal cells in the closely related species A. leptorhynchus In conclusion comparison between our and previous results reveals general and species-specific neural coding strategies. We hypothesize that differences in coding strategies when observed result from different stimulus distributions in the natural/social environment.,10.1152/jn.00594.2016
0,The phenotype of the social group is related to phenotypes of individuals that form that society. We examined how honey bee colony aggressiveness relates to individual response of male drones and foraging workers. Although the natural focus in colony aggression has been on the worker caste the sterile females engaged in colony maintenance and defense males carry the same genes. We measured aggressiveness scores of colonies and examined components of individual  aggressive behavior in workers and haploid sons of workers from the same colony.  We describe for the first time that males although they have no stinger do bend their abdomen (abdominal flexion) in a posture similar to stinging behavior  of workers in response to electric shock. Individual worker sting response and movement rates in response to shock were significantly correlated with colony scores. In the case of drones sons of workers from the same colonies abdominal  flexion significantly correlated but their movement rates did not correlate with  colony aggressiveness. Furthermore the number of workers responding at increasing levels of voltage exhibits a threshold-like response whereas the drones respond in increasing proportion to shock. We conclude that there are common and caste-specific components to aggressive behavior in honey bees. We discuss implications of these results on social and behavioral regulation and genetics of aggressive response.,10.1007/s00265-014-1689-8
0,During real-world (RW) exploration rodent hippocampal activity shows robust spatial selectivity which is hypothesized to be governed largely by distal visual cues although other sensory-motor cues also contribute. Indeed hippocampal spatial selectivity is weak in primate and human studies that use only visual cues. To determine the contribution of distal visual cues only we measured hippocampal activity from body-fixed rodents exploring a two-dimensional virtual reality (VR). Compared to that in RW spatial selectivity was markedly reduced during random foraging and goal-directed tasks in VR. Instead we found small but significant selectivity to distance traveled. Despite impaired spatial  selectivity in VR most spikes occurred within ∼2-s-long hippocampal motifs in both RW and VR that had similar structure including phase precession within motif fields. Selectivity to space and distance traveled were greatly enhanced in VR tasks with stereotypical trajectories. Thus distal visual cues alone are insufficient to generate a robust hippocampal rate code for space but are sufficient for a temporal code.,10.1038/nn.3884
0,Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex form a principal component of the mammalian neural representation of space. The firing pattern of a single grid cell has been hypothesized to be generated through attractor dynamics in a network with a specific local connectivity including both excitatory and inhibitory connections. However experimental evidence supporting the presence of such connectivity among grid cells in layer II is limited. Here we report recordings from more than 600 neuron pairs in rat entorhinal slices demonstrating that stellate cells the principal cell type in the layer II grid network are mainly interconnected via inhibitory interneurons. Using a model attractor network we demonstrate that stable grid firing can emerge from a simple recurrent inhibitory network. Our findings thus suggest that the observed  inhibitory microcircuitry between stellate cells is sufficient to generate grid-cell firing patterns in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex.,10.1038/nn.3310

0,The hippocampal cognitive map is thought to be driven by distal visual cues and self-motion cues. However other sensory cues also influence place cells. Hence  we measured rat hippocampal activity in virtual reality (VR) where only distal visual and nonvestibular self-motion cues provided spatial information and in the real world (RW). In VR place cells showed robust spatial selectivity; however only 20% were track active compared with 45% in the RW. This indicates  that distal visual and nonvestibular self-motion cues are sufficient to provide selectivity but vestibular and other sensory cues present in RW are necessary to fully activate the place-cell population. In addition bidirectional cells preferentially encoded distance along the track in VR while encoding absolute position in RW. Taken together these results suggest the differential contributions of these sensory cues in shaping the hippocampal population code. Theta frequency was reduced and its speed dependence was abolished in VR but phase precession was unaffected constraining mechanisms governing both hippocampal theta oscillations and temporal coding. These results reveal cooperative and competitive interactions between sensory cues for control over hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity and theta rhythm.,10.1126/science.1232655
0,How do external environmental and internal movement-related information combine to tell us where we are? We examined the neural representation of environmental location provided by hippocampal place cells while mice navigated a virtual reality environment in which both types of information could be manipulated. Extracellular recordings were made from region CA1 of head-fixed mice navigating  a virtual linear track and running in a similar real environment. Despite the absence of vestibular motion signals normal place cell firing and theta rhythmicity were found. Visual information alone was sufficient for localized firing in 25% of place cells and to maintain a local field potential theta rhythm (but with significantly reduced power). Additional movement-related information was required for normally localized firing by the remaining 75% of place cells. Trials in which movement and visual information were put into conflict showed that they combined nonlinearly to control firing location and that the relative  influence of movement versus visual information varied widely across place cells. However within this heterogeneity the behavior of fully half of the place cells conformed to a model of path integration in which the presence of visual cues at  the start of each run together with subsequent movement-related updating of position was sufficient to maintain normal fields.,10.1073/pnas.1215834110
0,When a rat crosses the place field of a hippocampal pyramidal cell this cell typically fires a series of spikes. Spike phases measured with respect to theta  oscillations of the local field potential on average decrease as a function of the spatial distance traveled. This relation between phase and position of spikes might be a neural basis for encoding and is called phase precession. The degree of association between the circular phase variable and the linear spatial variable is commonly quantified through however a linear-linear correlation coefficient where the circular variable is converted to a linear variable by restricting the phase to an arbitrarily chosen range which may bias the estimated correlation. Here we introduce a new measure to quantify circular-linear associations. This measure leads to a robust estimate of the slope and phase offset of the regression line and it provides a correlation coefficient for circular-linear data that is a natural analog of Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient for linear-linear data. Using surrogate data we show that the new method outperforms the standard linear-linear approach with respect to estimates of the regression line and the correlation and that the new method is less dependent on noise and sample size. We confirm these findings in a large data set of experimental recordings from hippocampal place cells and theta oscillations and we discuss remaining problems that are relevant for the analysis and interpretation of phase precession. In summary we provide a new method for the quantification of circular-linear associations.,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.03.007
0,Circadian rhythms in social insects are highly plastic and are modulated by multiple factors. In addition complex behaviors such as sun-compass orientation  and time learning are clearly regulated by the circadian system in these organisms. Despite these unique features of social insect clocks the mechanisms  as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of these traits remain largely unknown. Here we show a modification of the Drosophila activity monitoring (DAM) system that allowed us to measure locomotor rhythms of the honey bee Apis mellifera (three variants; gAHB carnica and caucasica) and two paper  wasps (Polistes crinitus and Mischocyttarus phthisicus). A side-by-side comparison of the endogenous period under constant darkness (free-running period) led us to the realization that these social insects exhibit significant deviations from the Earth's 24 h rotational period as well as a large degree of inter-individual variation compared with Drosophila. Experiments at different temperatures using honey bees as a model revealed that testing the endogenous rhythm at 35°C which is the hive's core temperature results in average periods  closer to 24 h compared with 25°C (23.8 h at 35°C versus 22.7 h at 25°C). This finding suggests that the degree of tuning of circadian temperature compensation  varies among different organisms. We expect that the commercial availability cost-effectiveness and integrated nature of this monitoring system will facilitate the growth of the circadian field in these social insects and catalyze our understanding of the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of circadian rhythms.,10.1242/jeb.096180
0,Oceanic islands have reduced resources and natural enemies and potentially affect life history traits of arriving organisms. Among the most spectacular invasions in the Western hemisphere is that of the Africanized honeybee. We hypothesized that in the oceanic island Puerto Rico Africanized bees will exhibit differences from the mainland population such as for defensiveness and other linked traits. We evaluated the extent of Africanization through three typical Africanized traits: wing size defensive behavior and resistance to Varroa destructor mites. All sampled colonies were Africanized by maternal descent with over 65% presence of European alleles at the S-3 nuclear locus. In two assays evaluating defense Puerto Rican bees showed low defensiveness similar to European bees. In morphology and resistance to mites Africanized bees from Puerto Rico are similar to other Africanized bees. In behavioral assays on mechanisms of resistance to Varroa we directly observed that Puerto Rican Africanized bees groomed-off and bit the mites as been observed in other studies. In no other location Africanized bees have reduced defensiveness while retaining typical traits such as wing size and mite resistance. This mosaic of traits that has resulted during  the invasion of an oceanic island has implications for behavior evolution and agriculture.,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00252.x
0,Goal-directed behavior in most cases is composed of a sequential order of elementary motor patterns shaped by sensorimotor contingencies. The sensory information acquired thus is structured in both space and time. Here we review the role of motion during the generation of sensory flow focusing on how animals  actively shape information by behavioral strategies. We use the well-studied examples of vision in insects and echolocation in bats to describe commonalities  of sensory-related behavioral strategies across sensory systems and evaluate what is currently known about comparable active sensing strategies in electroreception of electric fish. In this sensory system the sensors are dispersed across the animal's body and the carrier source emitting energy used for sensing the electric organ is moved while the animal moves. Thus ego-motions strongly influence sensory dynamics. We present for the first time  data of electric flow during natural probing behavior in Gnathonemus petersii (Mormyridae) which provide evidence for this influence. These data reveal a complex interdependency between the physical input to the receptors and the animal's movements posture and objects in its environment. Although research on  spatiotemporal dynamics in electrolocation is still in its infancy the emerging  field of dynamical sensory systems analysis in electric fish is a promising approach to the study of the link between movement and acquisition of sensory information.,10.1242/jeb.082420
0,Recent studies have shown that central nervous system neurons in weakly electric  fish respond to artificially constructed electrosensory envelopes but the behavioral relevance of such stimuli is unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that social context creates envelopes that drive behavior. When Eigenmannia virescens are in groups of three or more the interactions between their pseudo-sinusoidal electric fields can generate 'social envelopes'. We developed a simple mathematical prediction for how fish might respond to such social envelopes. To test this prediction we measured the responses of E. virescens to stimuli consisting of two sinusoids each outside the range of the Jamming Avoidance Response (JAR) that when added to the fish's own electric field produced low-frequency (below 10 Hz) social envelopes. Fish changed their electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency in response to these envelopes which we have termed the Social Envelope Response (SER). In 99% of trials the direction of the SER was consistent with the mathematical prediction. The SER was strongest in response to the lowest initial envelope frequency tested (2 Hz) and depended on stimulus amplitude. The SER generally resulted in an increase of the envelope  frequency during the course of a trial suggesting that this behavior may be a mechanism for avoiding low-frequency social envelopes. Importantly the direction of the SER was not predicted by the superposition of two JAR responses: the SER was insensitive to the amplitude ratio between the sinusoids used to generate the envelope but was instead predicted by the sign of the difference of difference frequencies.,10.1242/jeb.076513
0,Acute ethanol administration is associated with sedation and analgesia as well as behavioral disinhibition and memory loss but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated. During the past decade insects have emerged as  important model systems to understand the neural and genetic bases of alcohol effects. However novel assays to assess ethanol's effects on complex behaviors in social or isolated contexts are necessary. Here we used the honey bee as an especially relevant model system since bees are typically exposed to ethanol in nature when collecting standing nectar crop of flowers and there is recent evidence for independent biological significance of this exposure for social behavior. Bee's inhibitory control of the sting extension response (SER) and a conditioned-place aversion assay were used to study ethanol effects on analgesia behavioral disinhibition and associative learning. Our findings indicate that although ethanol in a dose-dependent manner increases SER thresholds (analgesic effects) it disrupts the ability of honey bees to inhibit SER and to associate aversive stimuli with their environment. These results suggest that ethanol's effects on analgesia behavioral disinhibition and associative learning are common across vertebrates and invertebrates. These results add to the use of honey bees as an ethanol model to understand ethanol's effects on complex socially relevant behaviors.,10.1371/journal.pone.0100894

0,Biogenic amines are widely characterized in pathways evaluating reward and punishment resulting in appropriate aversive or appetitive responses of vertebrates and invertebrates. We utilized the honey bee model and a newly developed spatial avoidance conditioning assay to probe effects of biogenic amines octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) on avoidance learning. In this new protocol non-harnessed bees associate a spatial color cue with mild electric shock punishment. After a number of experiences with color and shock the bees no  longer enter the compartment associated with punishment. Intrinsic aspects of avoidance conditioning are associated with natural behavior of bees such as punishment (lack of food explosive pollination mechanisms danger of predation  heat etc.) and their association to floral traits or other spatial cues during foraging. The results show that DA reduces the punishment received whereas octopamine OA increases the punishment received. These effects are dose-dependent and specific to the acquisition phase of training. The effects during acquisition are specific as shown in experiments using the antagonists Pimozide and Mianserin for DA and OA receptors respectively. This study demonstrates the integrative role of biogenic amines in aversive learning in the honey bee as modeled in a novel non-appetitive avoidance learning assay.,10.1371/journal.pone.0025371
0,Gears are found rarely in animals and have never been reported to intermesh and rotate functionally like mechanical gears. We now demonstrate functional gears in the ballistic jumping movements of the flightless planthopper insect Issus. The nymphs but not adults have a row of cuticular gear (cog) teeth around the curved medial surfaces of their two hindleg trochantera. The gear teeth on one trochanter engaged with and sequentially moved past those on the other trochanter during the preparatory cocking and the propulsive phases of jumping. Close registration between the gears ensured that both hindlegs moved at the same angular velocities to propel the body without yaw rotation. At the final molt to  adulthood this synchronization mechanism is jettisoned.,10.1126/science.1240284
0,BACKGROUND: The Africanized honey bee is one of the most spectacular invasions in the Americas. African bees escaped from apiaries in Brazil in 1956 spread over Americas and by 1994 they were reported in Puerto Rico. In contrast to other places the oceanic island conditions in Puerto Rico may mean a single introduction and different dynamics of the resident European and new-coming Africanized bees.To examine the genetic variation of honey bee feral populations  and colonies from different locations in Puerto Rico we used eight known polymorphic microsatellite loci. RESULTS: In Puerto Rico gAHB population does not show any genetic structure (Fst = 0.0783) and is best described as one honey bee population product of hybridization of AHB and EHB. The genetic variability in this Africanized population was similar to that reported in studies from Texas. We observed that European private allele frequencies are high in all but one locus. This contrasts with mainland Africanized populations where European allele frequencies are diminished. Two loci with European private alleles one on Linkage Group 7 known to carry two known defensiveness Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) and the other on Linkage Group 1 known to carry three functionally studied genes and 11 candidate genes associated with Varroa resistance mechanisms were respectively significantly greater or lower in European allele frequency than the other loci with European private alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic structure of Puerto Rico gAHB differs from mainland AHB populations probably representing evolutionary processes on the island.,10.1186/1471-2156-14-65
0,Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of  movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual-abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus-response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic-abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint subject to a high-pass filter is sufficient to maintain stable hovering but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or 'airframe' of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight  control. Furthermore the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable unstable regime.,10.1242/jeb.077644
0,We report that temporal spike sequences from hippocampal place neurons of rats on an elevated track recurred in reverse order at the end of a run but in forward order in anticipation of the run coinciding with sharp waves. Vector distances between the place fields were reflected in the temporal structure of these sequences. This bidirectional re-enactment of temporal sequences may contribute to the establishment of higher-order associations in episodic memory.,10.1038/nn1961
0,We recently reported a greater sensitivity of female rats to rapid antidepressant-like effects of ketamine compared to male rats and that ovarian-derived estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) are essential for this response. However to what extent testosterone may also contribute and whether duration of response to ketamine is modulated in a sex- and hormone-dependent manner remains unclear. To explore this we systematically investigated the influence of testosterone estradiol and progesterone on initiation and maintenance of hedonic response to low-dose ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) in intact and gonadectomized male and female rats. Ketamine induced a sustained increase in sucrose preference of female but not male rats in an E2P4-dependent manner. Whereas testosterone failed to alter male treatment response concurrent administration of P4 alone in intact males enhanced hedonic response low-dose ketamine. Treatment responsiveness in female rats only was associated with greater hippocampal BDNF levels but not activation of key downstream signaling effectors. We provide novel evidence supporting activational roles for ovarian-  but not testicular- derived hormones in mediating hedonic sensitivity to low-dose ketamine in female and male rats respectively. Organizational differences may in part account for the persistence of sex differences following gonadectomy and selective involvement of BDNF in treatment response.,10.1038/srep21322
0,Clinical evidence suggests superior antidepressant response over time with a repeated intermittent ketamine treatment regimen as compared to a single infusion. However the club drug ketamine is commonly abused. Therefore the abuse potential of repeated ketamine injections at low doses needs to be investigated. In this study we investigated the abuse potential of repeated exposure to either 0 2.5 or 5 mg/kg ketamine administered once weekly for seven weeks. Locomotor activity and conditioned place preference (CPP) were assayed to  evaluate behavioral sensitization to the locomotor activating effects of ketamine and its rewarding properties respectively. Our results show that while neither males nor females developed CPP males treated with 5 mg/kg and females treated with either 2.5 or 5 mg/kg ketamine behaviorally sensitized. Furthermore dendritic spine density was increased in the NAc of both males and females administered 5 mg/kg ketamine an effect specific to the NAc shell (NAcSh) in males but to both the NAc core (NAcC) and NAcSh in females. Additionally males administered 5 mg/kg ketamine displayed increased protein expression of ΔfosB calcium calmodulin kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) an effect not observed in females administered either dose of ketamine. However males and females administered 5 mg/kg ketamine displayed increased protein expression of AMPA receptors (GluA1). Taken together low-dose  ketamine when administered intermittently induces behavioral sensitization at a lower dose in females than males accompanied by an increase in spine density in  the NAc and protein expression changes in pathways commonly implicated in addiction.,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.05.003
0,"Rewards are both ""liked"" and ""wanted"" and those 2 words seem almost interchangeable. However the brain circuitry that mediates the psychological process of ""wanting"" a particular reward is dissociable from circuitry that mediates the degree to which it is ""liked."" Incentive salience or ""wanting"" a form of motivation is generated by large and robust neural systems that include  mesolimbic dopamine. By comparison ""liking"" or the actual pleasurable impact of reward consumption is mediated by smaller and fragile neural systems and is not dependent on dopamine. The incentive-sensitization theory posits the essence of drug addiction to be excessive amplification specifically of psychological ""wanting"" especially triggered by cues without necessarily an amplification of  ""liking."" This is because of long-lasting changes in dopamine-related motivation  systems of susceptible individuals called ""neural sensitization."" A quarter-century after its proposal evidence has continued to grow in support the incentive-sensitization theory. Further its scope is now expanding to include diverse behavioral addictions and other psychopathologies. (PsycINFO Database Record",10.1037/amp0000059
0,Systemic injections of 17β-estradiol (E2) in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats rapidly enhance dorsal striatal dopamine (DA) release in response to amphetamine  (AMPH). Additionally a single injection of E2 rapidly (within 30min) enhances amphetamine-induced DA release. In situ studies show that this rapid effect of E2 occurs specifically within the dorsal striatum (DS). The present study investigated the in vivo effects of E2 infused into the DS medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the substantia nigra (SN) on dorsal striatal DA release. Rats were OVX and implanted with a silastic tube containing 5% E2 in cholesterol previously shown to mimic low physiological serum concentrations of 18-32pg/ml. Single-probe microdialysis was used to measure extracellular DA levels in the DS. In addition DA release was measured subsequent to systemic injections of the indirect DA agonist AMPH (0.5mg/kg SC) administered simultaneously with E2 (0.544μg/100μl) or its vehicle cyclodextrin (VEH) (0.520μg/100μl). Local infusions of E2 into the DS resulted in a greater amphetamine-induced dorsal striatal DA release in comparison to vehicle. Local infusions of E2 into the mPFC or the SN did not result in an enhancement of amphetamine-induced DA levels in the DS. These studies suggest that increases in dorsal striatal DA release in response to systemic E2 are a consequence of E2 actions within the DS itself.,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.05.049
0,Facial vibrissae or whiskers are found in nearly all extant mammal species and  are likely to have been present in early mammalian ancestors. A sub-set of modern mammals including many rodents move their long mystacial whiskers back and forth at high speed whilst exploring in a behaviour known as 'whisking'. It is not known whether the vibrissae of early mammals moved in this way. The grey short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica is considered a useful species from  the perspective of tracing the evolution of modern mammals. Interestingly these  marsupials engage in whisking bouts similar to those seen in rodents. To better assess the likelihood that active vibrissal sensing was present in ancestral mammals we examined the vibrissal musculature of the opossum using digital miscroscopy to see whether this resembles that of rodents. Although opossums have fewer whiskers than rats our investigation found that they have a similar vibrissal musculature. In particular in both rats and opossums the musculature  includes both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles with the intrinsic muscles positioned as slings linking pairs of large vibrissae within rows. We identified  some differences in the extrinsic musculature which interestingly matched with  behavioural data obtained through high-speed video recording and indicated additional degrees of freedom for positioning the vibrissae in rats. These data show that the whisker movements of opossum and rat exploit similar underlying mechanisms. Paired with earlier results suggesting similar patterns of vibrissal  movement this strongly implies that early therian (marsupial and placental) mammals were whisking animals that actively controlled their vibrissae.,10.1242/jeb.087452
0,In rats the long facial whiskers (mystacial macrovibrissae) are repetitively and rapidly swept back and forth during exploration in a behaviour known as 'whisking'. In this paper we summarize previous evidence from rats and present  new data for rat mouse and the marsupial grey short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis  domestica) showing that whisking in all three species is actively controlled both with respect to movement of the animal's body and relative to environmental structure. Using automatic whisker tracking and Fourier analysis we first show  that the whisking motion of the mystacial vibrissae in the horizontal plane can be approximated as a blend of two sinusoids at the fundamental frequency (mean 8.5 11.3 and 7.3 Hz in rat mouse and opossum respectively) and its second harmonic. The oscillation at the second harmonic is particularly strong in mouse  (around 22 Hz) consistent with previous reports of fast whisking in that species. In all three species we found evidence of asymmetric whisking during head turning and following unilateral object contacts consistent with active control of whisker movement. We propose that the presence of active vibrissal touch in both rodents and marsupials suggests that this behavioural capacity emerged at an early stage in the evolution of therian mammals.,10.1098/rstb.2011.0156
0,Estradiol rapidly modulates hippocampal synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission; however the contribution of the various estrogen receptors to rapid changes in synaptic function is unclear. This study examined the effect of  estrogen receptor selective agonists on hippocampal synaptic transmission in slices obtained from 3-5-month-old wild type (WT) estrogen receptor alpha (ERαKO) and beta (ERβKO) knockout female ovariectomized mice. Hippocampal slices were prepared 10-16 days following ovariectomy and extracellular excitatory postsynaptic field potentials were recorded from CA3-CA1 synaptic contacts before and following application of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB 100 pM) the G-protein estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) agonist G1 (100 nM) the ERα selective agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT 100 nM) or the ERβ selective agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN 1 µM). Across all groups EB and G1 increased the synaptic response to a similar extent. Furthermore prior G1 application occluded the EB-mediated enhancement of the synaptic response and the GPER1 antagonist G15 (100 nM) inhibited the enhancement of the synaptic response induced by EB application. We  confirmed that the ERα and ERβ selective agonists (PPT and DPN) had effects on synaptic responses specific to animals that expressed the relevant receptor; however PPT and DPN produced only a small increase in synaptic transmission relative to EB or the GPER1 agonist. We demonstrate that the increase in synaptic transmission is blocked by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Furthermore EB was able to increase ERK activity regardless of genotype. These results suggest that ERK activation and enhancement of synaptic transmission by EB involves multiple estrogen receptor subtypes.,10.1002/hipo.22475
0,Estrogens are well known for their enhancing effects on hippocampus-sensitive cognition. However estrogens can also impair learning and memory particularly the acquisition of striatum-sensitive tasks. These cognitive shifts appear to be  mediated through local estrogen receptor (ER) activation in each neural structure but little information is known regarding which specific ER subtypes drive the opposing effects on learning. Elucidating the mnemonic roles of discrete ER subtypes is essential for predicting how treatments with distinct ER  pharmacology such as drugs hormone therapies and phytoestrogen supplements affect cognitive abilities in and thus the daily lives of the women who take them. The present study examined the effects of the ERα-selective compound propyl pyrazole triol and the ERβ-selective compounds diarylpropionitrile and Br-ERb-041 on place and response learning in young adult female rats. Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized and maintained on phytoestrogen-free chow for 3 weeks before behavioral training with treatments administered via subcutaneous injection 48 and 24 hours before testing. A dose-response paradigm was used with each compound tested at 4 different doses in separate groups of rats. Propyl pyrazole  triol diarylpropionitrile and Br-ERb-041 all enhanced place learning and impaired response learning albeit with distinct dose-response patterns for each  compound and task. These results are consistent with the detection of ERα and ERβ in the hippocampus and striatum and suggest that learning is modulated via activation of either ER subtype.,10.1210/en.2015-1616
0,PURPOSE: Tracking the motion of biological tissues represents an important issue  in the field of medical ultrasound imaging. However the longitudinal component of the motion (i.e. perpendicular to the beam axis) remains more challenging to  extract due to the rather coarse resolution cell of ultrasound scanners along this direction. The aim of this study is to introduce a real-time beamforming strategy dedicated to acquire tagged images featuring a distinct pattern in the objective to ease the tracking. METHODS: Under the conditions of the Fraunhofer approximation a specific apodization function was applied to the received raw channel data in real-time during image acquisition in order to introduce a periodic oscillations pattern along the longitudinal direction of the radio frequency signal. Analytic signals  were then extracted from the tagged images and subpixel motion tracking of the intima-media complex was subsequently performed offline by means of a previously introduced bidimensional analytic phase-based estimator. RESULTS: The authors' framework was applied in vivo on the common carotid artery  from 20 young healthy volunteers and 6 elderly patients with high atherosclerosis risk. Cine-loops of tagged images were acquired during three cardiac cycles. Evaluated against reference trajectories manually generated by three experienced  analysts the mean absolute tracking error was 98 ± 84 μm and 55 ± 44 μm in the longitudinal and axial directions respectively. These errors corresponded to 28% ± 23% and 13% ± 9% of the longitudinal and axial amplitude of the assessed motion respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework enables tagged ultrasound images of in vivo tissues to be acquired in real-time.

Multiscale AFOF (MAFOF) exploits the information obtained with AFOF from the approximation sub-images at different spatial resolution levels of the images obtained using a 2D discrete wavelet transform. Both AFOF and MAFOF were evaluated through their application to synthetic image sequences of the common carotid artery. Multiscale image analysis increased the accuracy in motion tracking with MAFOF yielding average displacement error reductions of 9% with respect to AFOF. The methods were also effectively applied to real ultrasound image sequences of the carotid artery. The results showed that MAFOF could be considered as a reliable estimator for arterial wall motion from B-mode ultrasound images.,10.1109/iembs.2011.6090103

0,We aim at investigating arterial diseases at early stage by assessing the longitudinal (i.e. in the same direction as the blood flow) motion of the intima-media complex. This recently evidenced phenomenon has been shown to provide relevant and complementary information about vascular health. Our method  assesses the longitudinal and radial motion from clinical in vivo B-mode ultrasound sequences. To estimate the trajectory of a selected point during the cardiac cycle we introduce a block matching method that involves a temporal update of the reference block using a pixel-wise Kalman filter. The filter uses the initial gray-level of the pixel as control signal to avoid divergence due to  cumulating errors. The block and search-window sizes are adapted to the tissue of interest. The method was evaluated on image sequences of the common carotid artery acquired in 57 healthy volunteers and in 25 patients at high cardiovascular risk. Reference trajectories were generated for each sequence by averaging the tracings performed by three observers. Six different computerized techniques were also compared to our method. With a pixel size of 30 μm the average absolute motion estimation errors were 84 ± 107 μm and 20 ± 19 μm for the longitudinal and radial directions respectively. This accuracy was of the same order of magnitude as the inter- and intra-observers variability and smaller than for the other methods. The estimated longitudinal motion amplitude was significantly reduced in at-risk patients compared with healthy volunteers (408 ± 281 μm vs. 643 ± 274 μm p<0.0001). Our method can constitute a reliable and time-saving technique to investigate the arterial stiffness in clinical studies  in the objective to detect early-stage atherosclerosis.,10.1016/j.media.2013.03.006

0,To investigate the factors contributing to pioglitazone-induced edema we analyzed sodium excretion and several clinical parameters before and after administration of pioglitazone. We analyzed these parameters before and after 8 weeks of administration of pioglitazone to female subjects with type 2 diabetes. When we evaluated whether a significant correlation was found between salt excretion and blood pressure six patients showed such correlation and 20 patients did not. After 8 weeks of pioglitazone administration five patients had developed edema and surprisingly such correlation was not found in all five subjects. Salt excretion after administration of pioglitazone was significantly lower in subjects who developed edema and those who showed the correlation and the hematocrit was significantly lower after administration in the subjects who showed the correlation but not in the edema group. Pioglitazone-induced edema would be caused not only by fluid retention but also by other factors such as vascular permeability.

0,Planning can be defined as action selection that leverages an internal model of the outcomes likely to follow each possible action. Its neural mechanisms remain  poorly understood. Here we adapt recent advances from human research for rats presenting for the first time an animal task that produces many trials of planned behavior per session making multitrial rodent experimental tools available to study planning. We use part of this toolkit to address a perennially controversial issue in planning: the role of the dorsal hippocampus. Although prospective hippocampal representations have been proposed to support planning intact planning in animals with damaged hippocampi has been repeatedly observed.  Combining formal algorithmic behavioral analysis with muscimol inactivation we provide causal evidence directly linking dorsal hippocampus with planning behavior. Our results and methods open the door to new and more detailed investigations of the neural mechanisms of planning in the hippocampus and throughout the brain.,10.1038/nn.4613

0,Flying animals accomplish high-speed navigation through fields of obstacles using a suite of sensory modalities that blend spatial memory with input from vision tactile sensing and in the case of most bats and some other animals echolocation. Although a good deal of previous research has been focused on the role of individual modes of sensing in animal locomotion our understanding of sensory integration and the interplay among modalities is still meager. To understand how bats integrate sensory input from echolocation vision and spatial memory we conducted an experiment in which bats flying in their natural  habitat were challenged over the course of several evening emergences with a novel obstacle placed in their flight path. Our analysis of reconstructed flight  data suggests that vision echolocation and spatial memory together with the possible exercise of an ability in using predictive navigation are mutually reinforcing aspects of a composite perceptual system that guides flight. Together with the recent development in robotics our paper points to the possible interpretation that while each stream of sensory information plays an important role in bat navigation it is the emergent effects of combining modalities that enable bats to fly through complex spaces.,10.1038/srep27252

0,Recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field but the way  in which this is used by them for navigation to a home roost remains unresolved.  The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds directional information appears to be derived from an  interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation. Unlike in birds however the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration. For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed this is a surprising finding. Yet it may indicate the primacy of the sun as an absolute geographical reference not only for birds but also within other vertebrate taxa.,10.1073/pnas.0912477107
0,"Navigation the ability to reach desired goal locations is critical for animals  and humans. Animal navigation has been studied extensively in birds insects and some marine vertebrates and invertebrates yet we are still far from elucidating  the underlying mechanisms in other taxonomic groups especially mammals. Here we  report a systematic study of the mechanisms of long-range mammalian navigation. High-resolution global positioning system tracking of bats was conducted here which revealed high fast and very straight commuting flights of Egyptian fruit  bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) from their cave to remote fruit trees. Bats returned to the same individual trees night after night. When displaced 44 km south bats  homed directly to one of two goal locations--familiar fruit tree or cave--ruling  out beaconing route-following or path-integration mechanisms. Bats released 84  km south within a deep natural crater were initially disoriented (but eventually left the crater toward the home direction and homed successfully) whereas bats released at the crater-edge top homed directly suggesting navigation guided primarily by distal visual landmarks. Taken together these results provide evidence for a large-scale ""cognitive map"" that enables navigation of a mammal within its visually familiar area and they also demonstrate the ability to home back when translocated outside the visually familiar area.",10.1073/pnas.1107365108

0,Why do different species of birds start their dawn choruses at different times? We test the hypothesis that the times at which different species start singing at dawn are related to their visual capability at low light intensities. Birds with  large eyes can achieve greater pupil diameters and hence all other things being  equal greater visual sensitivity and resolution than birds with small eyes. We estimated the maximum pupil diameter of passerine birds by measuring the diameter of the exposed eye surface and measured the times of the first songs at dawn of  songbirds present in different bird communities and the light intensities at these times. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses we found that songbirds with large eyes started to sing at lower light intensities (and therefore earlier) than species with smaller eyes. These relationships were stronger when differences in body size were controlled for statistically and were consistent between two phylogenies and when species were treated as independent data points. Our results therefore provide robust support for the hypothesis that visual capability at low light levels influences the times at which birds start to sing  at dawn.,10.1098/rspb.2001.1941
0,In a recent study Greif et al. (Greif et al. Nat Commun 5 4488. (doi:10.1038/ncomms5488)) demonstrated a functional role of polarized light for a bat species confronted with a homing task. These non-migratory bats appeared to calibrate their magnetic compass by using polarized skylight at dusk yet it is unknown if migratory bats also use these cues for calibration. During autumn migration we equipped Nathusius' bats Pipistrellus nathusii with radio transmitters and tested if experimental animals exposed during dusk to a 90° rotated band of polarized light would head in a different direction compared with control animals. After release bats of both groups continued their journey in the same direction. This observation argues against the use of a polarization-calibrated magnetic compass by this migratory bat and questions that the ability of using polarized light for navigation is a consistent feature in bats. This finding matches with observations in some passerine birds that used polarized light for calibration of their magnetic compass before but not during migration.,10.1098/rsbl.2015.0525

0,"Echolocating bats can be divided into guilds according to their preferred habitat and foraging behaviour which coincide with distinct adaptations in wing morphology and structure of echolocation signals. Although coarse structuring of  niche space between different guilds is generally accepted it is not clear how niches differ within guilds or whether there is fine-grained niche differentiation reflected in echolocation signal structure. Using a standardized  performance test here we show clutter-dependent differences in prey-capture success for bats from five species of European Myotis. These species are morphologically similar sympatric and all belong to the guild labelled ""edge space aerial/trawling foragers"". We further demonstrate a strong correlation between the prey-detection ability of the species and the respective search-call  bandwidth. Our findings indicate that differences in echolocation signals contribute to within-guild niche differentiation. This is the first study relating sensory abilities of a set of potentially competing animal species to a  direct measure of their respective foraging performance suggesting an important  role of sensory ecology in the structuring of animal communities.",10.1038/nature02547
0,At any one moment many neuronal groups in our brain are active. Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication  is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure which subserves  our cognitive flexibility.,10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.011

The synaptonemal complex karyotype of the macrobivalents shows an excellent correspondence with the mitotic karyotype. The number and distribution of recombination nodules (RNs) were scored in complete nuclei stained with phosphotungstic acid. The average number of RNs per nucleus is 64.7. The number of nodules per bivalent shows a clear linear relationship with SC length in the 10 longest synaptonemal complexes while the microbivalents usually bear a single RN.

The ZZ bivalent is the fourth in size and shows free recombination having on average 3.8 RNs. The mean number of nodules per cell and the mean number of nodules in the largest bivalents show very good agreement with the corresponding number of chiasmata scored in metaphase-I spermatocytes. It is concluded that the recombination nodules provide a good check for reciprocal exchanges in this and other species of birds.

0,"The directionality of bat echolocation calls defines the width of bats' sonar ""view"" while call intensity directly influences detection range since adequate sound energy must impinge upon objects to return audible echoes. Both are thus crucial parameters for understanding biosonar signal design. Phyllostomid bats have been classified as low intensity or ""whispering bats"" but recent data indicate that this designation may be inaccurate. Echolocation beam directionality in phyllostomids has only been measured through electrode brain-stimulation of restrained bats presumably excluding active beam control via the noseleaf. Here a 12-microphone array was used to measure echolocation call intensity and beam directionality in the frugivorous phyllostomid Carollia  perspicillata echolocating in flight. The results showed a considerably narrower beam shape (half-amplitude beam angles of approximately 16° horizontally and 14°  vertically) and louder echolocation calls [source levels averaging 99 dB sound pressure level (SPL) root mean square] for C. perspicillata than was found for this species when stationary. This suggests that naturally behaving phyllostomids shape their sound beam to achieve a longer and narrower sonar range than previously thought. C. perspicillata orient and forage in the forest interior and the narrow beam might be adaptive in clutter by reducing the number and intensity of off-axis echoes.",10.1121/1.3519396
0,"When echolocating big brown bats fly in complex surroundings echoes arriving from irrelevant objects (clutter) located to the sides of their sonar beam can mask perception of relevant objects located to the front (targets) causing ""blind spots."" Because the second harmonic is beamed more weakly to the sides than the first harmonic these clutter echoes have a weaker second harmonic. In psychophysical experiments we found that electronically misaligning first and second harmonics in echoes (to mimic the misalignment of corresponding neural responses to harmonics in clutter echoes) disrupts the bat's echo-delay perception but also prevents clutter masking. Electronically offsetting harmonics to realign their neural responses restores delay perception but also clutter interference. Thus bats exploit harmonics to distinguish clutter echoes from target echoes sacrificing delay acuity to suppress masking.",10.1126/science.1202065

0,Mormyrid electric fish are a model system for understanding how neural circuits predict the sensory consequences of motor acts. Medium ganglion cells in the electrosensory lobe create negative images that predict sensory input resulting from the fish's electric organ discharge (EOD). Previous studies have shown that  negative images can be created through plasticity at granule cell-medium ganglion cell synapses provided that granule cell responses to the brief EOD command are  sufficiently varied and prolonged. Here we show that granule cells indeed provide such a temporal basis and that it is well-matched to the temporal structure of self-generated sensory inputs allowing rapid and accurate sensory cancellation and explaining paradoxical features of negative images. We also demonstrate an unexpected and critical role of unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in generating the required delayed responses. These results provide a mechanistic account of how copies of motor commands are transformed into sensory predictions.,10.1038/nn.3650
0,Little is known about the genetic basis of convergent traits that originate repeatedly over broad taxonomic scales. The myogenic electric organ has evolved six times in fishes to produce electric fields used in communication navigation predation or defense. We have examined the genomic basis of the convergent anatomical and physiological origins of these organs by assembling the genome of  the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and sequencing electric organ and skeletal muscle transcriptomes from three lineages that have independently evolved electric organs. Our results indicate that despite millions of years of  evolution and large differences in the morphology of electric organ cells independent lineages have leveraged similar transcription factors and developmental and cellular pathways in the evolution of electric organs.,10.1126/science.1254432

0,Animal communication signals that simultaneously share the same sensory channel are likely to co-evolve to maximize the transmission of each signal component. Weakly electric fish continuously produce a weak electric field that functions in communication. Fish modulate the electric organ discharge (EOD) on short timescales to produce context-specific signals called chirps. EODs and chirps are simultaneously detected by electroreceptors and processed in the electrosensory system. We analyzed these signals first to explore whether EOD waveform is encoded in the signal received by electroreceptors and then to examine how EODs and chirps interact to influence conspicuousness. Our findings show that gross discrimination of sinusoidal from complex EOD waveforms is feasible for all species but fine discrimination of waveform may be possible only for species with waveforms of intermediate complexity. The degree of chirp frequency modulation and chirp relative decay strongly influenced chirp conspicuousness but other chirp parameters were less influential. The frequency difference between the interacting EODs also strongly impacted chirp conspicuousness. Finally we developed a method for creating hybrid chirp/EOD combinations to independently analyze the impact of chirp species EOD species and EOD difference frequency on chirp conspicuousness. All three components and their interactions strongly influenced chirp conspicuousness which suggests that evolutionary changes in parameters of either chirps or EODs are likely to influence chirp detection. Examining other environmental factors such as noise created by fish movement and species-typical patterns of sociality may enrich our understanding of how interacting EODs affect the detection and discrimination of  chirps across species.,10.1016/j.jphysparis.2016.10.005
0,Although communication signals often vary continuously on the underlying signal parameter they are perceived as distinct categories. We here report the opposite case where an electrocommunication signal is encoded in four distinct regimes although the behavior described to date does not show distinct categories. In particular we studied the encoding of chirps by P-unit afferents in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. These fish generate an electric organ discharge that oscillates at a certain individual-specific frequency. The interaction of two fish in communication contexts leads to the emergence of a beating amplitude modulation (AM) at the frequency difference between the two individual signals. This frequency difference represents the social context of the encounter. Chirps are transient increases of the fish's frequency leading to  transient changes in the frequency of the AM. We stimulated the cells with the same chirp on different naturally occurring backgrounds beats. The P-units responded either by synchronization or desynchronization depending on the background. Although the duration of a chirp is often shorter than a full cycle of the AM it elicits the distinct responses of the P-units to the chirp can be predicted solely from the frequency of the AM based on the static frequency tuning of the cells.,10.1152/jn.00576.2013
0,BACKGROUND: Considerable controversy exists on the association between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. A meta-analysis was performed  to assess the dose-response relationship of long-term coffee consumption with CVD risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for prospective cohort studies of the relationship between coffee consumption and CVD risk which included coronary heart disease stroke heart failure and CVD mortality. Thirty-six studies were included with 1 279 804 participants and 36 352 CVD cases. A nonlinear relationship of coffee consumption with CVD risk was identified (P for heterogeneity=0.09 P for trend <0.001 P for nonlinearity <0.001). Compared with the lowest category of coffee consumption (median 0 cups  per day) the relative risk of CVD was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.87-1.03)  for the highest category (median 5 cups per day) category 0.85 (95% confidence  interval 0.80-0.90) for the second highest category (median 3.5 cups per day)  and 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.84-0.94) for the third highest category (median 1.5 cups per day). Looking at separate outcomes coffee consumption was  nonlinearly associated with both coronary heart disease (P for heterogeneity=0.001 P for trend <0.001 P for nonlinearity <0.001) and stroke (P for heterogeneity=0.07 P for trend <0.001 P for nonlinearity <0.001; P for trend differences >0.05) risks. CONCLUSIONS: A nonlinear association between coffee consumption and CVD risk was  observed in this meta-analysis. Moderate coffee consumption was inversely significantly associated with CVD risk with the lowest CVD risk at 3 to 5 cups per day and heavy coffee consumption was not associated with elevated CVD risk.,10.1161/circulationaha.113.005925
0,BACKGROUND: The effect of coffee and caffeine on blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hypertensive persons is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to summarize the evidence on the acute and longer-term effects of caffeine and coffee intake on BP and on the association between habitual coffee consumption and risk of CVD in hypertensive individuals. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of publications identified in a PubMed and EMBASE search up to 30 April 2011 was undertaken. Data were extracted  from controlled trials on the effect of caffeine or coffee intake on BP change and from cohort studies on the association between habitual coffee consumption and CVD. RESULTS: In 5 trials the administration of 200-300 mg caffeine produced a mean increase of 8.1 mm Hg (95% CI: 5.7 10.6 mm Hg) in systolic BP and of 5.7 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.1 7.4 mm Hg) in diastolic BP. The increase in BP was observed in the  first hour after caffeine intake and lasted ≥3 h. In 3 studies of the longer-term effect (2 wk) of coffee no increase in BP was observed after coffee was compared with a caffeine-free diet or was compared with decaffeinated coffee. Last 7 cohort studies found no evidence of an association between habitual coffee consumption and a higher risk of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive individuals caffeine intake produces an acute increase in BP for ≥3 h. However current evidence does not support an association between longer-term coffee consumption and increased BP or between habitual coffee consumption and an increased risk of CVD in hypertensive subjects.,10.3945/ajcn.111.016667
