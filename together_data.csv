Recent studies have shown diverse connectivity patterns across the thalamus but whether this diversity translates to thalamic functions beyond relaying information to or between cortical regions is unknown. Here we show by  investigating the representation of two rules used to guide attention in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) that the mediodorsal thalamus sustains these representations without relaying categorical information. Specifically mediodorsal input amplifies local PFC connectivity enabling rule-specific neural sequences to emerge and thereby maintain rule representations. Consistent with this notion broadly enhancing PFC excitability diminishes rule specificity and behavioural performance whereas enhancing mediodorsal excitability improves both. Overall our results define a previously unknown principle in neuroscience; thalamic control of functional cortical connectivity. This function which is dissociable from categorical information relay indicates that the thalamus has a much broader role in cognition than previously thought.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1038%2Fnature22073&report=abstract&format=text","2017",1132.002,1225,0,FALSE,1,0,4,0

In contrast the hippocampal electroencephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7-12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field the complex  spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the  same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100 degrees to 355 degrees in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior such as the time after place field  entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields.

A fundamental issue is whether and how this capability is used in information processing. According to the 'cell assembly' hypothesis transient synchrony of anatomically  distributed groups of neurons underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly neuron populations should be arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation  by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30 ms suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time window for synaptic plasticity we propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1038%2Fnature01834&report=abstract&format=text","2003",4,1291,4,TRUE,0,1,3,1

This is referred to as the rate code. However the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise timing of spikes over short timescales (<10 ms). Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory  inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning.

These forms of learning have the property of slow acquisition and in humans can occur without conscious awareness. This paper proposes that one aspect of basal ganglia-based learning is the recoding of cortically derived  information within the striatum. Modular corticostriatal projection patterns demonstrated experimentally are viewed as producing recoded templates suitable for the gradual selection of new input-output relations in cortico-basal ganglia  loops. Recordings from striatal projection neurons and interneurons show that activity patterns in the striatum are modified gradually during the course of S-R learning. It is proposed that this recoding within the striatum can chunk the representations of motor and cognitive action sequences so that they can be implemented as performance units. This scheme generalizes Miller's notion of information chunking to action control. The formation and the efficient implementation of action chunks are viewed as being based on predictive signals.  It is suggested that information chunking provides a mechanism for the acquisition and the expression of action repertoires that without such information compression would be biologically unwieldy or difficult to implement. The learning and memory functions of the basal ganglia are thus seen as core features of the basal ganglia's influence on motor and cognitive pattern generators.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1006%2Fnlme.1998.3843&report=abstract&format=text","1998",8,1485,0,FALSE,0,1,5,0

Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to control sensory selection. To test this idea and more  generally dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection we developed a cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally precise window the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN  activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition.

In addition to socioeconomic influences biologic factors are believed to play a critical role in prostate cancer disparities. We investigated whether population-specific and -enriched miRNA-mRNA interactions might contribute to prostate cancer disparities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Integrative genomics was used combining miRNA and mRNA profiling miRNA target prediction pathway analysis and functional validation  to map miRNA-mRNA interactions associated with prostate cancer disparities. RESULTS: We identified 22 AA-specific and 18 EA-specific miRNAs in prostate cancer versus patient-matched normal prostate and 10 ""AA-enriched/-depleted"" miRNAs in AA prostate cancer versus EA prostate cancer comparisons. Many of these population-specific/-enriched miRNAs could be paired with target mRNAs that exhibited an inverse pattern of differential expression. Pathway analysis revealed EGFR (or ERBB) signaling as a critical pathway significantly regulated by AA-specific/-enriched mRNAs and miRNA-mRNA pairings. Novel miRNA-mRNA pairings were validated by qRT-PCR Western blot and/or IHC analyses in prostate cancer specimens.

Neurobiological correlates of consciousness are discussed with structures like the ascending reticular activating system the amygdala the cerebellum the thalamus the frontoparietal circuits the prefrontal cortex and the precuneus. The cellular and microlevel theories of consciousness and cerebral activity at the neuronal level contributing to consciousness are highlighted along with the  various theories posited in this area. The role of neuronal assemblies and circuits along with firing patterns and their ramifications for the understanding of consciousness are discussed. A section on the role of anaesthesia and its links to consciousness is presented along with details of split-brain studies in consciousness and altered states of awareness including the vegetative states. The article finally discusses the progress cognitive psychology has made in identifying and theorising various perspectives of consciousness perceptual awareness and conscious processing. Both recent and past researches are highlighted. The importance and salient features of each theory are discussed along with the pitfalls if present. A need for integration of various theories to understand consciousness from a holistic perspective is stressed to enable one to reach a theory that explains the ultimate neurobiology of consciousness.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.4103%2F0973-1229.109335&report=abstract&format=text","2013",15.578,1769,0,FALSE,0,1,0,0

Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas.

When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the  irrelevant distractor.

Computational modeling uniquely designed to infer  the electrical currents underlying these signals showed that beta events could emerge from the integration of nearly synchronous bursts of excitatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons where the defining feature of a beta event was a strong distal drive that lasted one beta period (∼50 ms). This beta mechanism rigorously accounted for the beta event profiles; several other mechanisms did not. The spatial location of synaptic drive in the model to supragranular and infragranular layers was critical to the  emergence of beta events and led to the prediction that beta events should be associated with a specific laminar current profile. Laminar recordings in somatosensory neocortex from anesthetized mice and awake monkeys supported these  predictions suggesting this beta mechanism is conserved across species and recording modalities. These findings make several predictions about optimal states for perceptual and motor performance and guide causal interventions to modulate beta for optimal function.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1073%2Fpnas.1604135113&report=abstract&format=text","2016",55.58,1674,9,TRUE,1,1,0,0

We analyzed these signals first to explore whether EOD waveform is encoded in the signal received by electroreceptors and then to examine how EODs and chirps interact to influence conspicuousness. Our findings show that gross discrimination of sinusoidal from complex EOD waveforms is feasible for all species but fine discrimination of waveform may be possible only for species with waveforms of intermediate complexity. The degree of chirp frequency modulation and chirp relative decay strongly influenced chirp conspicuousness but other chirp parameters were less influential. The frequency difference between the interacting EODs also strongly impacted chirp conspicuousness. Finally we developed a method for creating hybrid chirp/EOD combinations to independently analyze the impact of chirp species EOD species and EOD difference frequency on chirp conspicuousness. All three components and their interactions strongly influenced chirp conspicuousness which suggests that evolutionary changes in parameters of either chirps or EODs are likely to influence chirp detection.

We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones.

However it is unknown whether microglial somal volume or density are altered in the cortex and whether any alteration is associated with age or other potential covariates. METHODS: Microglia in sections from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of nonmacrencephalic male cases with autism (n = 13) and control cases (n = 9) were  visualized via ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 immunohistochemistry. In addition to a neuropathological assessment microglial cell density was stereologically estimated via optical fractionator and average somal volume was quantified via isotropic nucleator. RESULTS: Microglia appeared markedly activated in 5 of 13 cases with autism including 2 of 3 under age 6 and marginally activated in an additional 4 of 13 cases. Morphological alterations included somal enlargement process retraction and thickening and extension of filopodia from processes. Average microglial somal volume was significantly increased in white matter (p = .013) with a trend in gray matter (p = .098). Microglial cell density was increased in gray matter (p = .002). Seizure history did not influence any activation measure. CONCLUSIONS: The activation profile described represents a neuropathological alteration in a sizeable fraction of cases with autism.

Functional hyperemia the basis of the functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD signal is a localized influx of blood correlated with neural activity levels. Functional hyperemia is considered by many to be excessive from a metabolic standpoint but may be appropriate if interpreted as having an activity-dependent neuro-modulatory function.

Direct mechanisms include delivery of diffusible blood-borne messengers and mechanical and thermal modulation of neural activity. Indirect mechanisms are proposed to act through hemodynamic modulation of astrocytes which can in turn regulate neural activity. These hemo-neural mechanisms should alter the information processing capacity of active local neural networks. Here  we focus on analysis of neocortical sensory processing. We predict that hemodynamics alter the gain of local cortical circuits modulating the detection  and discrimination of sensory stimuli.

The axial swimming muscles of these fishes also attach to the feeding apparatus and have the potential to generate mouth expansion. Because of their large size these axial muscles could contribute substantial power to suction feeding. To determine whether suction feeding is powered primarily by axial muscles we measured the power required for suction expansion in largemouth bass and compared it to the power capacities of the axial and cranial muscles. Using X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) we generated 3D animations of the mouth skeleton and created a dynamic digital endocast to measure the rate of mouth volume expansion. This time-resolved expansion rate was combined with intraoral pressure recordings to calculate the instantaneous power required for suction feeding. Peak expansion powers for all but the weakest strikes far exceeded the maximum power capacity of the cranial muscles. The axial muscles did not merely contribute but were the primary source of suction expansion power and  generated up to 95% of peak expansion power.

To understand how bats integrate sensory input from echolocation vision and spatial memory we conducted an experiment in which bats flying in their natural  habitat were challenged over the course of several evening emergences with a novel obstacle placed in their flight path. Our analysis of reconstructed flight  data suggests that vision echolocation and spatial memory together with the possible exercise of an ability in using predictive navigation are mutually reinforcing aspects of a composite perceptual system that guides flight.

We asked whether RL could also account for the emergence of habitual action sequences in realistically complex situations in which no repetitive stimulus-response links were present and in which many response options were present. We exposed naïve macaque monkeys to such experimental conditions by introducing a unique free saccade scan task. Despite the highly uncertain conditions and no instruction the monkeys developed a succession of stereotypical self-chosen saccade sequence patterns.

Prima facie these continued behavioral changes appeared to challenge RL.

Understanding the correlation between distinct aspects of neural activity and the BOLD response is  fundamental to the interpretation of this widely used mapping signal. Analysis of this question requires the ability to precisely manipulate the activity of defined neurons. To achieve such control we combined optogenetic drive of neocortical neurons with high-resolution (9.4 T) rodent fMRI and detailed analysis of neurophysiological data. Light-driven activation of pyramidal neurons resulted in a positive BOLD response at the stimulated site. To help differentiate the neurophysiological correlate(s) of the BOLD response we employed light trains of the same average frequency but with periodic and Poisson distributed pulse times. These different types of pulse trains generated  dissociable patterns of single-unit multi-unit and local field potential (LFP) activity and of BOLD signals. The BOLD activity exhibited the strongest correlation to spiking activity with increasing rates of stimulation and to a first approximation was linear with pulse delivery rate while LFP activity showed a weaker correlation. These data provide an example of a strong correlation between spike rate and the BOLD response.

However the mechanistic origin of beta in vivo is unknown hindering understanding of its functional role. Combining human magnetoencephalography (MEG) computational modeling and laminar recordings in animals we present a new theory that accounts for the origin of spontaneous neocortical beta. In our MEG data spontaneous beta activity from somatosensory and frontal cortex emerged as noncontinuous beta events typically lasting <150 ms with a stereotypical waveform. Computational modeling uniquely designed to infer  the electrical currents underlying these signals showed that beta events could emerge from the integration of nearly synchronous bursts of excitatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons where the defining feature of a beta event was a strong distal drive that lasted one beta period (∼50 ms). This beta mechanism rigorously accounted for the beta event profiles; several other mechanisms did not. The spatial location of synaptic drive in the model to supragranular and infragranular layers was critical to the  emergence of beta events and led to the prediction that beta events should be associated with a specific laminar current profile. Laminar recordings in somatosensory neocortex from anesthetized mice and awake monkeys supported these  predictions suggesting this beta mechanism is conserved across species and recording modalities. These findings make several predictions about optimal states for perceptual and motor performance and guide causal interventions to modulate beta for optimal function.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1073%2Fpnas.1604135113&report=abstract&format=text","2016",55.58,1674,9,TRUE,1,1,0,0

However epithelial cell division  must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that  later die. However it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is  activated as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell  density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide Piezo1 localizes to  the plasma membrane and cytoplasm whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1038%2Fnature21407&report=abstract&format=text","2017",129.858,1914,10,TRUE,0,0,2,0

Homologs of AII amacrine cells have yet to be identified in non-mammalians but we propose that such homologs should be narrow-field glycinergic amacrine cells driving photopic ON-OFF crossover via heterocellular coupling with ON cone bipolar cells and glycinergic synapses on OFF cone bipolar cells. The specific evolutionary event creating the mammalian AII scotopic-photopic hub would then simply be the emergence of large numbers of  pure rod bipolar cells.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.3389%2Ffncir.2014.00104&report=abstract&format=text","2014",16.924,1888,5,TRUE,0,0,1,0

The grey short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica is considered a useful species from  the perspective of tracing the evolution of modern mammals. Interestingly these  marsupials engage in whisking bouts similar to those seen in rodents. To better assess the likelihood that active vibrissal sensing was present in ancestral mammals we examined the vibrissal musculature of the opossum using digital miscroscopy to see whether this resembles that of rodents. Although opossums have fewer whiskers than rats our investigation found that they have a similar vibrissal musculature. In particular in both rats and opossums the musculature  includes both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles with the intrinsic muscles positioned as slings linking pairs of large vibrissae within rows. We identified  some differences in the extrinsic musculature which interestingly matched with  behavioural data obtained through high-speed video recording and indicated additional degrees of freedom for positioning the vibrissae in rats. These data show that the whisker movements of opossum and rat exploit similar underlying mechanisms.

In all three species we found evidence of asymmetric whisking during head turning and following unilateral object contacts consistent with active control of whisker movement.

In our MEG data spontaneous beta activity from somatosensory and frontal cortex emerged as noncontinuous beta events typically lasting <150 ms with a stereotypical waveform. Computational modeling uniquely designed to infer  the electrical currents underlying these signals showed that beta events could emerge from the integration of nearly synchronous bursts of excitatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons where the defining feature of a beta event was a strong distal drive that lasted one beta period (∼50 ms). This beta mechanism rigorously accounted for the beta event profiles; several other mechanisms did not. The spatial location of synaptic drive in the model to supragranular and infragranular layers was critical to the  emergence of beta events and led to the prediction that beta events should be associated with a specific laminar current profile.

The probability of inducing seizures was frequency-dependent reaching a maximum at 10 Hz. 2) Local field potential power before stimulation and response amplitudes during stimulation both predicted seizure induction demonstrating a modulatory effect of brain states and neural excitation levels. 3) Evoked responses during stimulation propagated as cortical waves likely reaching the cortical focus which in turn generated self-sustained SWDs after stimulation was terminated.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity and age on slip severity and rate of falling resulting from laboratory-induced slips. Four groups of participants (young obese young non-obese older obese older non-obese) were slipped while walking at a self-selected slightly hurried pace. Slip severity (slip distance slip duration mean slip speed and peak slip speed) and slip outcome (fall or recovery) were compared between groups. Obese individuals experienced 22% faster  slips than non-obese individuals in terms of mean slip speed (p=0.022). Obesity did not affect slip distance slip duration or peak slip speed. Obese individuals also exhibited a higher rate of falls; 32% of obese individuals fell compared to  10% of non-obese (p=0.005). Obese individuals were more than eight times more likely to experience a fall than non-obese individuals when adjusting for age gender and gait speed. No age effects were found for slip severity or slip outcome. These results along with epidemiological data reporting higher fall rates among the obese indicate that obesity may be a significant risk factor for experiencing slip-induced falls. Slip severity thresholds were also reported that may have value in developing controls for fall prevention.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1016%2Fj.jbiomech.2016.01.018&report=abstract&format=text","2016",6.05,1618,18,TRUE,2,0,1,0

The purpose of this population-based propensity score-matched longitudinal follow-up study was to determine whether there is an increased risk  of ischemic stroke after PD. METHODS: We used a logistic regression model that includes age sex pre-existing comorbidities and socioeconomic status as covariates to compute the propensity score. A total of 2204 patients with at least two ambulatory visits with the principal diagnosis of PD in 2001 was enrolled in the PD group. The non- PD group consisted of 2204 propensity score-matched subjects without PD. The ischemic stroke-free survival rates of the two groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression with patients  matched on propensity score was used to estimate the effect of PD on the occurrence of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: During the three-year follow-up period 328 subjects in the PD group and 156 subjects in the non-PD group developed ischemic stroke. The ischemic stroke-free survival rate of the PD group was significantly lower than that of the non-PD group (P<0.0001). The hazard ratio (HR) of stroke for the PD group was 2.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.92 to 2.93 P<0.0001) compared to the non-  PD group.

However the longitudinal component of the motion (i.e. perpendicular to the beam axis) remains more challenging to  extract due to the rather coarse resolution cell of ultrasound scanners along this direction. The aim of this study is to introduce a real-time beamforming strategy dedicated to acquire tagged images featuring a distinct pattern in the objective to ease the tracking. METHODS: Under the conditions of the Fraunhofer approximation a specific apodization function was applied to the received raw channel data in real-time during image acquisition in order to introduce a periodic oscillations pattern along the longitudinal direction of the radio frequency signal. Analytic signals  were then extracted from the tagged images and subpixel motion tracking of the intima-media complex was subsequently performed offline by means of a previously introduced bidimensional analytic phase-based estimator.

Here we investigate the possibility that social context creates envelopes that drive behavior. When Eigenmannia virescens are in groups of three or more the interactions between their pseudo-sinusoidal electric fields can generate 'social envelopes'. We developed a simple mathematical prediction for how fish might respond to such social envelopes. To test this prediction we measured the responses of E. virescens to stimuli consisting of two sinusoids each outside the range of the Jamming Avoidance Response (JAR) that when added to the fish's own electric field produced low-frequency (below 10 Hz) social envelopes. Fish changed their electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency in response to these envelopes which we have termed the Social Envelope Response (SER). In 99% of trials the direction of the SER was consistent with the mathematical prediction. The SER was strongest in response to the lowest initial envelope frequency tested (2 Hz) and depended on stimulus amplitude. The SER generally resulted in an increase of the envelope  frequency during the course of a trial suggesting that this behavior may be a mechanism for avoiding low-frequency social envelopes. Importantly the direction of the SER was not predicted by the superposition of two JAR responses: the SER was insensitive to the amplitude ratio between the sinusoids used to generate the envelope but was instead predicted by the sign of the difference of difference frequencies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1242%2Fjeb.076513&report=abstract&format=text","2012",3.25,1662,5,TRUE,1,1,3,0

Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual-abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus-response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic-abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint subject to a high-pass filter is sufficient to maintain stable hovering but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or 'airframe' of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight  control. Furthermore the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable unstable regime.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1242%2Fjeb.077644&report=abstract&format=text","2013",26,1567,4,TRUE,0,2,3,0

Contrary to current views this suggests that premotor activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the accumulation process  but instead has a more categorical function such as transforming accumulated evidence into a discrete choice. To probe causally the role of FOF activity we optogenetically silenced it during different time points of the trial.

Furthermore attenuation of vHIP-NAc transmission by optogenetic induction of long-term depression is pro-resilient whereas acute enhancement of this input is pro-susceptible. This effect is specific to vHIP afferents to the NAc as optogenetic stimulation of either mPFC or AMY afferents  to the NAc is pro-resilient. These data indicate that vHIP afferents to NAc uniquely regulate susceptibility to CSDS highlighting an important novel circuit-specific mechanism in depression.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1038%2Fncomms8062&report=abstract&format=text","2015",9.3,1050,0,FALSE,0,1,0,0

We found that these long-range inhibitory projections enhance the specificity of contextual and object memory encoding.

This phenomenon alters the intrinsic properties of dopamine (DA) neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) leading to enhanced dopaminergic transmission in the mesocorticolimbic network. The mechanisms underlying this augmented excitation are nonetheless poorly understood. DA neurons display the hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation current dubbed Ih We recently demonstrated that Ih and membrane capacitance are substantially reduced in VTA DA cells from cocaine-sensitized rats. The present study shows that 7 days of cocaine withdrawal did not normalize Ih and capacitance. In cells from cocaine-sensitized animals the amplitude of excitatory synaptic potentials at -70 mV was ∼39% larger in contrast to controls. Raise and decay phases of the synaptic signal were faster under cocaine a result associated with a reduced membrane time constant. Synaptic summation was paradoxically elevated by cocaine exposure as it consisted of a significantly reduced summation indexed but a considerably increased depolarization. These effects are at least a consequence of the reduced capacitance. Ih attenuation is unlikely to explain such observations since at -70 mV no statistical differences exist in Ih or input resistance. The neuronal  shrinkage associated with a diminished capacitance may help to understand two fundamental elements of drug addiction: incentive sensitization and negative emotional states. A reduced cell size may lead to substantial enhancement of cue-triggered bursting which underlies drug craving and reward anticipation whereas it could also result in DA depletion as smaller neurons might express low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase.NEW & NOTEWORTHY: This work uses a new approach that directly extracts important biophysical parameters from alpha function-evoked synaptic potentials. Two of these parameters are the cell membrane capacitance (Cm) and rate at any time point of the synaptic waveform. The use of such methodology shows that cocaine sensitization reduces Cm and increases the speed of synaptic signaling. Paradoxically although synaptic potentials show a faster decay under cocaine their temporal summation is substantially elevated.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1152%2Fjn.00465.2016&report=abstract&format=text","2017",1.5,2314,7,TRUE,3,5,2,0

OBJECTIVE: To determine if gabapentin a widely prescribed generic calcium channel/γ-aminobutyric acid-modulating medication increases rates of sustained abstinence and no heavy drinking and decreases alcohol-related insomnia dysphoria and craving in a dose-dependent manner. DESIGN PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized dose-ranging trial of 150 men and women older than 18 years with current alcohol dependence conducted from 2004 through 2010 at a single-site outpatient clinical research facility adjoining a general medical hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Oral gabapentin (dosages of 0 [placebo] 900 mg or 1800 mg/d) and concomitant manual-guided counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of complete abstinence and no heavy drinking (coprimary) and changes in mood sleep and craving (secondary) over the 12-week  study. RESULTS Gabapentin significantly improved the rates of abstinence and no heavy drinking. The abstinence rate was 4.1% (95% CI 1.1%-13.7%) in the placebo  group 11.1% (95% CI 5.2%-22.2%) in the 900-mg group and 17.0% (95% CI 8.9%-30.1%) in the 1800-mg group (P = .04 for linear dose effect; number needed to treat [NNT] = 8 for 1800 mg). The no heavy drinking rate was 22.5% (95% CI 13.6%-37.2%) in the placebo group 29.6% (95% CI 19.1%-42.8%) in the 900-mg group and 44.7% (95% CI 31.4%-58.8%) in the 1800-mg group (P = .02 for linear dose effect; NNT = 5 for 1800 mg). Similar linear dose effects were obtained with measures of mood (F2 = 7.37; P = .001) sleep (F2 = 136; P < .001) and craving (F2 = 3.56; P = .03).

Here we provide proof-of-principle of this approach by using a BCI to interpret pathological brain activity in patients with advanced Parkinson  disease (PD) and to use this feedback to control when therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is delivered. Our goal was to demonstrate that by personalizing and optimizing stimulation in real time we could improve on both the efficacy and efficiency of conventional continuous DBS. METHODS: We tested BCI-controlled adaptive DBS (aDBS) of the subthalamic nucleus  in 8 PD patients. Feedback was provided by processing of the local field potentials recorded directly from the stimulation electrodes. The results were compared to no stimulation conventional continuous stimulation (cDBS) and random intermittent stimulation. Both unblinded and blinded clinical assessments  of motor effect were performed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Motor scores improved by 66% (unblinded) and 50% (blinded) during aDBS  which were 29% (p = 0.03) and 27% (p = 0.005) better than cDBS respectively. These improvements were achieved with a 56% reduction in stimulation time compared to cDBS and a corresponding reduction in energy requirements (p < 0.001). aDBS was also more effective than no stimulation and random intermittent  stimulation.

APPROACH: The tremor prediction algorithm uses a set of spectral (Fourier and wavelet) and nonlinear time series (entropy and recurrence rate) parameters extracted from the non-invasively recorded sEMG and acceleration signals. MAIN RESULTS: The resulting algorithm is shown to successfully predict tremor onset for all 91 trials recorded in 4 PD patients and for all 91 trials recorded  in 4 ET patients. The predictor achieves a 100% sensitivity for all trials considered along with an overall accuracy of 85.7% for all ET trials and 80.2% for all PD trials. By using a Pearson's chi-square test the prediction results are shown to significantly differ from a random prediction outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: The tremor prediction algorithm can be potentially used for designing the next generation of non-invasive closed-loop predictive ON-OFF controllers for deep brain stimulation (DBS) used for suppressing pathological tremor in such patients. Such a system is based on alternating ON and OFF DBS periods an incoming tremor being predicted during the time intervals when DBS is OFF so as to turn DBS back ON. The prediction should be a few seconds before tremor re-appears so that the patient is tremor-free for the entire DBS ON-OFF cycle and the tremor-free DBS OFF interval should be maximized in order to minimize the current injected in the brain and battery usage.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1088%2F1741-2560%2F10%2F3%2F036019&report=abstract&format=text","2013",4,1655,15,TRUE,2,1,3,1

Thalamic deep brain stimulation a surgical therapy for otherwise intractable cases has been shown to improve tremor but its impact on cerebellar-like gait difficulties remains to be elucidated. Eleven  patients affected by essential tremor (five females; age 69.8 ± 3.9 years; disease duration 24.4 ± 11.2 years; follow-up after surgery 24.7 ± 20.3 months) were evaluated during the following conditions: stimulation off stimulation on and supra-therapeutic stimulation. Ten age-matched healthy controls served as the comparison group. Locomotion by patients and controls was assessed with (i) overground gait and tandem gait; (ii) balance-assisted treadmill tandem gait and  (iii) unassisted treadmill gait. The two treadmill paradigms were kinematically analysed using a 3D opto-electronic motion analysis system. Established clinical  and kinesiological measures of ataxia were computed. During stimulation off the  patients exhibited ataxia in all assessment paradigms which improved during stimulation on and worsened again during supra-therapeutic stimulation. During over ground tandem gait patients had more missteps and slower gait velocities during stimulation off and supra-therapeutic stimulation than during stimulation  on. During balance-assisted tandem gait stimulation on reduced the temporospatial variability in foot trajectories to nearly normal values while highly variable (ataxic) foot trajectories were observed during stimulation off and supra-therapeutic stimulation. During unassisted treadmill gait stimulation  on improved gait stability compared with stimulation off and supra-therapeutic stimulation as demonstrated by increased gait velocity and ankle rotation. These improvements in ataxia were not a function of reduced tremor in the lower limbs or torso. In conclusion we demonstrate the impact of thalamic stimulation on gait ataxia in patients with essential tremor with improvement by stimulation on  and deterioration by supra-therapeutic stimulation despite continued control of  tremor. Thus cerebellar dysfunction in these patients can be differentially modulated with optimal versus supra-therapeutic stimulation. The cerebellar movement disorder of essential tremor is due to a typical cerebellar deficit not to trembling extremities. We hypothesize that deep brain stimulation affects two  major regulating circuits: the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop for tremor reduction and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway for ataxia reduction (stimulation on)  and ataxia induction (supra-therapeutic stimulation).","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawq267&report=abstract&format=text","2010",1,2747,18,TRUE,0,0,0,2

We show that plasticity of electrical synapses that results from paired spiking activity in coupled neurons depends on calcium influx and calcium-initiated signalling pathways. Plasticity that results from tetanization  of input fibres does not depend on calcium influx or dynamics. These results imply that electrically coupled neurons have distinct sets of mechanisms for adjusting coupling according to the specific type of activity they experience. ABSTRACT: Recent results have demonstrated modification of electrical synapse strength by varied forms of neuronal activity. However the mechanisms underlying plasticity induction in central mammalian neurons are unclear. Here we show that  the two established inductors of plasticity at electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus - paired burst spiking in coupled neurons and mGluR-dependent tetanization of synaptic input - are separate pathways that converge at a common downstream endpoint. Using occlusion experiments and pharmacology in patched pairs of coupled neurons in vitro we show that burst-induced depression depends on calcium entry via voltage-gated channels is  blocked by BAPTA chelation and recruits intracellular calcium release on its way to activation of phosphatase activity. In contrast mGluR-dependent plasticity is independent of calcium entry or calcium dynamics. Together these results show that the spiking-initiated mechanisms underlying electrical synapse plasticity are similar to those that induce plasticity at chemical synapses and offer the possibility that calcium-regulated mechanisms may also lead to alternate outcomes such as potentiation. Because these mechanistic elements are widely found in mature neurons we expect them to apply broadly to electrical synapses across the brain acting as the crucial link between neuronal activity and electrical synapse strength.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1113%2Fjp274049&report=abstract&format=text","2017",0.25,2041,0,FALSE,5,0,1,0

However the contribution of differences in PKA intracellular cascade  to the known sex differences in responses to cocaine is not well understood. This study examined whether there are intrinsic or cocaine-induced alterations in PKA-mediated responses such as phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein in male and female rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To this end protein levels of PKA and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in the caudate putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female rats were measured basally or after acute (one 30-mg/kg intraperitoneal injection) or chronic (twice-daily 15-mg/kg injections for 14 days) cocaine administration. Behavioral responses to both cocaine administration paradigms were also studied. RESULTS: Similar to previous findings ambulatory rearing and stereotypic activities were higher in female rats after acute cocaine administration. Sex differences in cocaine-induced responses were also observed after chronic cocaine administration: While males developed a robust sensitization in ambulatory activities to cocaine females developed tolerance in cocaine-induced rearing and stereotypic activities. In the basal group females had significantly higher PKA  protein levels in the NAc. Regardless of the cocaine administration paradigm PKA protein levels in the NAc were higher overall in females than in males. Furthermore after cocaine administration while pCREB protein levels in male rats were induced for a longer amount of time than in female rats the magnitude  of change on pCREB levels were higher in female than male rats. However in the CPu no sex differences in PKA or pCREB protein levels were observed either in the basal group or after acute or chronic cocaine administration. DISCUSSION: Taken together these findings suggest that sex differences in basal  and cocaine-induced alterations in the PKA signaling regulation in the NAc may contribute to sex differences in the psychomotor responses to cocaine.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007%2Fs00213-008-1411-5&report=abstract&format=text","2009",3,2149,6,TRUE,2,1,0,0

However it is  unclear whether repeated administration alters motor impulsivity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We examined the effects of acute administration of morphine and amphetamine prior to and during daily morphine administration in rats responding under a five-choice serial reaction time task. Rats (n = 5) were  trained to detect a brief flash of light presented randomly in one of five response holes; responding in the target hole delivered food whereas responding  in the wrong hole or responding prior to illumination of the target stimulus (premature response) initiated a timeout. Premature responding served as an index of motor impulsivity. KEY RESULTS: Administered acutely morphine (0.1-10 mg·kg(-1)  i.p.) increased omissions and modestly although not significantly premature responding without  affecting response accuracy; amphetamine (0.1-1.78 mg·kg(-1)  i.p.) increased premature responding without changing omissions or response accuracy. After 3 weeks of 10 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1) morphine tolerance developed to its effects on  omissions whereas premature responding increased approximately fourfold compared with baseline. Effects of amphetamine were not significantly affected by daily morphine administration. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that repeated administration of  morphine increased effects of morphine on motor impulsivity although tolerance developed to other effects such as omissions.

We used a spatial noise stimulus for mapping interactions between MTCs belonging to different glomeruli in the dorsal bulb. Analyzing firing responses of MTCs to the stimulus we did not find robust lateral inhibitory effects that were spatially specific. However analysis of sub-threshold changes in the membrane potential revealed evidence for inhibitory interactions between MTCs that belong to different glomerular units. These lateral inhibitory effects were  short-lived and spatially specific. MTC response maps showed hyperpolarizing effects radially extending over more than five glomerular diameters. The inhibitory maps exhibited non-symmetrical yet distance-dependent characteristics.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.3389%2Ffncir.2016.00015&report=abstract&format=text","2016",0.75,1253,1,TRUE,0,2,5,0

Indeed during sleep and waking inactivity hippocampal SWRs in rodents appear to support spatial long-term and working memory [4 15-23] but so far they have not been linked to memory in primates. More recently SWRs have been observed during active visual scene exploration in macaques [24] opening up the possibility that these active-state ripples in the  primate hippocampus are linked to memory for objects embedded in scenes. By measuring hippocampal SWRs in macaques during search for scene-contextualized objects we found that SWR rate increased with repeated presentations. Furthermore gaze during SWRs was more likely to be near the target object on repeated than on novel presentations even after accounting for overall differences in gaze location with scene repetition. This proximity bias with repetition occurred near the time of target object detection for remembered targets. The increase in ripple likelihood near remembered visual objects suggests a link between ripples and memory in primates; specifically SWRs may reflect part of a mechanism supporting the guidance of search based on past experience.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1016%2Fj.cub.2016.11.027&report=abstract&format=text","2017",11.2,1624,14,TRUE,0,1,1,0
